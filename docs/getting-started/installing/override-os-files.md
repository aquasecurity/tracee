# Special: Overriding OS needed files

Tracee supports eBPF CO-RE (Compile Once - Run Everywhere) technology and,
because of that, it might need some information about the Linux OS it is
running at. Tracee, through libbpfgo, must have access to /etc/os-release file
AND either /boot/config-$(uname-r) OR /proc/config.gz files (KernelConfig API
at helpers/kernel_config).

> Note that, despite having this need, tracee will try to execute as CO-RE eBPF
> program in any environment it is executed.

## OS-RELEASE

Tracee will show you collected information about the running Linux OS with the
`--log debug` argument:

```console
sudo ./dist/tracee --log debug --filter uid=1000 --filter pid=new --filter event=execve
```

BUT **os-release file might not exist**:

Because you're running in a distribution that does not have /etc/os-release, or
because you're running inside a container that does not support it, you may
face the following error:

```console
sudo ./dist/tracee --log debug --filter uid=1000 --filter pid=new --filter event=execve
```

```

!!! Note
    But do note that **tracee shall continue working** (informing only the
    KERNEL_RELEASE OSInfo option).

If you need to override the underlying Linux OS information, because you're
running inside a container that already has /etc/os-release file, for example,
you may create another os-release file and inform tracee by using
LIBBPFGO's environment variable `LIBBPFGO_OSRELEASE_FILE`:

```console
sudo LIBBPFGO_OSRELEASE_FILE=/etc/os-release.orig ./dist/tracee --filter uid=1000 --filter pid=new --filter event=execve
```

> If you're running tracee inside a docker container, you can simply bind mount
> /etc/os-release from the host as /etc/os-release-host into the guest and
> inform that through the `LIBBPFGO_OSRELEASE_FILE` environment variable.

## KCONFIG

Tracee needs access to kconfig file (/proc/config.gz OR /boot/config-$(uname -r)) in order to:

1. Check if the kernel of your running environment supports needed eBPF features
2. Provide kconfig variables to its eBPF counter-part (so eBPF program take decisions)

!!! Warning
    Tracee **should NOT fail** when it cannot find a kconfig file:
    
    ```console
    sudo ./dist/tracee --log debug --filter uid=1000 --filter pid=new --filter event=execve
    ```

    ```text

    ...
    ```
    
    but do have in mind it is assuming some things from the host environment and
    its behavior might have inconsistencies.
    
    If you are running tracee in an environment that does not have a kconfig file
    (nor /proc/config.gz support), it is recommended that you provide the host
    kconfig file location to tracee through the `LIBBPFGO_KCONFIG_FILE` environment
    variable:

```console
sudo LIBBPFGO_KCONFIG_FILE=/boot/config-other -E ./dist/tracee --log debug --filter uid=1000 --filter pid=new --filter event=execve
```

!!! Attention
    In case no kconfig file is found, tracee takes some decisions blindly and
    it may give you unexpected errors. Example:
