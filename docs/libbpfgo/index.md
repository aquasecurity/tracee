# `libbpfgo`

`libbpfgo` is a Go library that allows working with the Linux eBPF subsystem via `libbpf`. `libbpf` is a C library that's developed as part of the Linux kernel tree which provides an accessible layer of abstraction on top of the raw eBPF system APIs. `libbpfgo` is just a thin wrapper in Go around `libbpf`.
