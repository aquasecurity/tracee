## About Tracee

Tracee is a runtime security and observability tool that helps you understand how your system and applications behave.  
It is using [eBPF technology](https://ebpf.io/what-is-ebpf/) to tap into your system and expose that information as events that you can consume.  
Events range from factual system activity events to sophisticated security events that detect suspicious behavioral patterns.

To learn more about Tracee, check out the [documentation](https://aquasecurity.github.io/tracee/). 

## Quickstart

To quickly try Tracee use one of the following snippets. For a more complete installation guide, check out the [Installation section][installation].  
Tracee should run on most common Linux distributions and kernels. For compatibility information see the [Prerequisites][prereqs] page. MacOS users, please read it too.

### Using Docker

```shell
docker run --name tracee \
  --pid=host --cgroupns=host --privileged \
