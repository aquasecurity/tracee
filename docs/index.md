## About Tracee

Tracee is a runtime security and observability tool that helps you understand how your system and applications behave using [eBPF technology](https://ebpf.io/what-is-ebpf/). It provides deep visibility into Linux systems by monitoring system calls, network activity, and file operations in real-time.

### What Tracee Does

- **üîç System Monitoring**: Tracks system calls, process execution, file operations, and network activity
- **üõ°Ô∏è Security Detection**: Identifies suspicious behavior patterns and potential security threats
- **üìä Observability**: Provides detailed insights into application and system behavior
- **üö® Real-time Alerts**: Generates events for immediate threat detection and response

### Key Features

- **Zero Code Changes**: Monitor existing applications without modification
- **Low Overhead**: Minimal performance impact using efficient eBPF programs
- **Container Aware**: Native support for containerized environments and Kubernetes
- **Flexible Policies**: Customize what to monitor and how to respond to events
- **Rich Event Data**: Detailed context including process lineage, file paths, and network connections

### Use Cases

- **Security Monitoring**: Detect malware, privilege escalation, and suspicious activity
- **Compliance**: Monitor file access, data exfiltration, and system changes
- **Troubleshooting**: Debug application issues and system behavior
- **Forensics**: Investigate security incidents with detailed audit trails

## Quickstart

To quickly try Tracee use one of the following snippets. For a more complete installation guide, check out the [Installation section][installation].  
Tracee should run on most common Linux distributions and kernels. For compatibility information see the [Prerequisites][prereqs] page. Mac users, please read [this FAQ][macfaq].

### Using Docker

```shell
docker run --name tracee -it --rm \
  --pid=host --cgroupns=host --privileged \
  -v /etc/os-release:/etc/os-release-host:ro \
  -v /var/run:/var/run:ro \
  aquasec/tracee:latest
```

For a complete walkthrough please see the [Docker getting started guide][docker-guide].

### On Kubernetes

```shell
helm repo add aqua https://aquasecurity.github.io/helm-charts/
helm repo update
helm install tracee aqua/tracee --namespace tracee --create-namespace
```

```shell
kubectl logs --follow --namespace tracee daemonset/tracee
```

For a complete walkthrough please see the [Kubernetes getting started guide][kubernetes-guide].
