.SS NAME
\f[B]socket_accept\f[R] \- socket connection acceptance monitoring
.SS DESCRIPTION
Triggered when a socket accepts an incoming connection through the
\f[CR]accept\f[R] or \f[CR]accept4\f[R] system calls.
This event provides comprehensive information about accepted
connections, including local and remote addresses, enabling detailed
monitoring of server\-side network activity and connection patterns.
.PP
Socket acceptance is fundamental to server applications and network
services, but monitoring these operations provides valuable insight into
network communication patterns and potential security threats.
.SS EVENT SETS
\f[B]none\f[R]
