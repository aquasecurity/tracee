.SS NAME
\f[B]vfs_writev\f[R] \- virtual filesystem vectorized write operation
monitoring
.SS DESCRIPTION
Triggered when a vectorized write operation (writev) is performed
through the Virtual File System (VFS) layer.
This event captures vectorized file write operations where multiple
buffers are written to a file in a single system call, providing
detailed monitoring of efficient bulk write operations.
.PP
Vectorized writes allow applications to write multiple data segments
efficiently, and this event provides insight into these optimized I/O
patterns at the VFS level.
