.SS NAME
\f[B]dropped_executable\f[R] \- Detection of dropped executables
signature
.SS DESCRIPTION
The \f[B]dropped_executable\f[R] signature is designed to identify
instances where a new executable file is introduced into the system
during runtime.
This type of activity can often be a significant security concern,
especially in containerized environments where images are generally
built with all necessary binaries included.
.PP
When running containers, a primary security principle is the
immutability of container images.
This means that once a container image is built, it should have all the
binaries and libraries it needs to function.
Any deviation from this, such as dropping or introducing new executables
during runtime, is often a sign of malicious intent or an indication
that the container\[cq]s integrity has been compromised.
.PP
The signature vigilantly monitors for such anomalies.
If it detects that a new executable has been introduced into the runtime
environment, it triggers an alert.

.SS DATA FIELDS
Once an unexpected executable drop is detected, the signature generates
a Finding that contains:
.TP
\f[B]SigMetadata\f[R] (\f[I]object\f[R])
Essential metadata that provides context regarding the detected
event\[cq]s nature and potential threat level
.TP
\f[B]Event\f[R] (\f[I]object\f[R])
An exhaustive log of the triggering event, offering a detailed
perspective of the issue
.TP
\f[B]Data\f[R] (\f[I]object\f[R])
Points out the specific path where the unexpected executable has been
located, helping to pinpoint the source of the potential breach
