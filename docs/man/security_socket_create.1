.SS NAME
\f[B]security_socket_create\f[R] \- LSM socket creation monitoring
.SS DESCRIPTION
Triggered when the Linux Security Module (LSM) framework performs
security checks on socket creation operations.
This event provides information about the type of socket being created,
including the protocol family, socket type, and protocol details,
captured at the LSM level before socket establishment.
.PP
This event is valuable for network security monitoring as it captures
socket creation with complete context, allowing security tools to
monitor and control network communications before they occur.
.SS EVENT SETS
