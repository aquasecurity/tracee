.SS NAME
\f[B]security_mmap_file\f[R] \- LSM memory mapping operation monitoring
.SS DESCRIPTION
Triggered when the Linux Security Module (LSM) framework performs
security checks on file memory mapping operations.
Memory mapping allows files to be mapped directly into process memory
space, which is commonly used for shared libraries, executables, and
data files.
.PP
This event is crucial for security monitoring as memory mapping can be
used for code injection, library loading, shared memory communication,
and other security\-relevant operations that affect process memory
layout and execution.
