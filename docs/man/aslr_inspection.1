.SS NAME
\f[B]aslr_inspection\f[R] \- ASLR inspection detection signature
.SS DESCRIPTION
The \f[B]aslr_inspection\f[R] signature detects instances where the ASLR
(address space layout randomization) configuration is being read.
ASLR is a vital security mechanism used by Linux operating systems to
randomize the memory locations used by processes, making it more
difficult to exploit vulnerabilities that rely on predictable memory
addresses.
.PP
However, adversaries may seek to inspect or even disable ASLR in their
attempts to exploit vulnerabilities.
The signature specifically tracks attempts to open and read the ASLR
configuration from its standard location
(\f[CR]/proc/sys/kernel/randomize_va_space\f[R]).
.PP
By alerting on instances where the ASLR configuration is being
inspected, the system can identify potential preparatory actions by
adversaries who might be gearing up for more direct attacks or exploit
attempts.
Disabling or altering ASLR can be a crucial step in a larger attack
plan.
