.SS NAME
\f[B]security_file_open\f[R] \- LSM file open operation monitoring
.SS DESCRIPTION
Triggered when the Linux Security Module (LSM) framework performs
security checks on file open operations.
This event provides detailed information about file access attempts,
including the file path, access flags, and filesystem metadata, captured
at the LSM level after path resolution but before the actual file
operation.
.PP
This event is particularly valuable for security monitoring as it
captures file access with complete context and is commonly used by
security signatures to detect access to sensitive files or suspicious
file operations.

The flags used for opening the file (O_RDONLY, O_WRONLY, O_RDWR, etc.)
.TP
\f[B]dev\f[R] (\f[I]uint32\f[R])
The device number of the filesystem containing the file
.TP
