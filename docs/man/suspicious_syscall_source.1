.SS NAME
\f[B]suspicious_syscall_source\f[R] \- syscall invoked from unusual code
location
.SS DESCRIPTION
Triggered when a system call is invoked from an unusual code location
that is not in a dedicated code region (VMA \- Virtual Memory Area)
mapped from executable files.
This event detects potential code injection, shellcode execution, or
other malicious activities where code is executed from unexpected memory
locations.
.PP
Normally, all legitimate code runs from dedicated code regions mapped
from executable files.
When syscalls are invoked from stack, heap, or anonymous memory regions,
it often indicates malicious activity such as shellcode execution or
code injection attacks.

syscall
.TP
