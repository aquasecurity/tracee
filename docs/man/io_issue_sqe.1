.SS NAME
\f[B]io_issue_sqe\f[R] \- io_uring submission queue entry issuance
monitoring
.SS DESCRIPTION
Triggered when an io_uring submission queue entry (SQE) is issued for
processing by the kernel.
This event captures the moment when io_uring requests are dispatched for
execution, providing detailed information about the operation type,
target file, and execution context.
.PP
This event is crucial for understanding io_uring I/O patterns and
tracking asynchronous operations as they transition from submission to
execution.
It captures the file being operated on, the operation type (read, write,
fsync, etc.), and whether the operation is running in a dedicated kernel
polling thread (SQPOLL mode) or an asynchronous worker context.
.SS EVENT SETS
\f[B]io_uring\f[R]
.SS DATA FIELDS
.TP
\f[B]path\f[R] (\f[I]string\f[R])
The path of the file being operated on
.TP
\f[B]device\f[R] (\f[I]uint32\f[R])
The device identifier where the file resides
.TP
\f[B]inode\f[R] (\f[I]uint64\f[R])
The inode number of the file on the device
.TP
\f[B]opcode\f[R] (\f[I]uint8\f[R])
The io_uring operation code (IORING_OP_READ, IORING_OP_WRITE,
IORING_OP_WRITEV, etc.)
.TP
\f[B]user_data\f[R] (\f[I]uint64\f[R])
User\-supplied data that will be echoed back in the completion event,
used for tracking requests
.TP
\f[B]flags\f[R] (\f[I]uint32\f[R])
Request flags (e.g., REQ_F_FIXED_FILE, REQ_F_LINK, REQ_F_CLEAR_POLLIN)
.TP
\f[B]sq_thread\f[R] (\f[I]bool\f[R])
Whether the operation is being issued from a kernel submission queue
polling thread (SQPOLL mode)
.TP
\f[B]sq_thread_id\f[R] (\f[I]uint32\f[R])
Thread ID of the submitting thread (useful for correlating async
operations with their origin)
