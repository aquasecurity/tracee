.SS NAME
\f[B]register_chrdev\f[R] \- character device registration monitoring
.SS DESCRIPTION
Triggered when a character device is registered with the kernel using
the \f[CR]__register_chrdev\f[R] function.
This event captures the registration of character devices, which provide
a stream\-based interface for hardware devices, virtual devices, and
other character\-oriented device drivers.
.PP
Character device registration is performed by device drivers to make
their functionality available to user space through device files in
\f[CR]/dev\f[R], but can also be used by rootkits to establish
communication channels or maintain persistence.
