.SS NAME
\f[B]security_bpf_map\f[R] \- LSM BPF map operation monitoring
.SS DESCRIPTION
Triggered when the Linux Security Module (LSM) framework performs
security checks on BPF map operations.
BPF maps are key\-value stores used by BPF programs to store and share
data.
This event provides information about BPF map access and manipulation,
including the map ID and name.
.PP
BPF maps are critical components of BPF programs and can contain
sensitive data or control program behavior, making monitoring of map
operations important for security and data protection.
