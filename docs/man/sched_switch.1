.SS NAME
\f[B]sched_switch\f[R] \- CPU scheduler context switch event
.SS DESCRIPTION
Triggered when the CPU scheduler switches between processes or threads
on a CPU core.
This event provides detailed information about both the previous and
next processes, including their identifiers and command names.
It captures the low\-level context switching that occurs in the kernel
scheduler.
.PP
This event is fundamental for understanding system scheduling behavior,
CPU utilization patterns, and process execution flow at the most
granular level.
