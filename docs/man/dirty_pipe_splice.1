.SS NAME
\f[B]dirty_pipe_splice\f[R] \- dirty pipe vulnerability exploitation
detection
.SS DESCRIPTION
Triggered when the kernel\[cq]s \f[CR]do_splice\f[R] function is called
in conditions that could be exploited by the \[lq]Dirty Pipe\[rq]
vulnerability (CVE\-2022\-0847).
This event specifically monitors for splice operations that could
potentially be used to overwrite read\-only files, which was the core
mechanism of the Dirty Pipe exploit.
.PP
The Dirty Pipe vulnerability allowed unprivileged users to overwrite
data in read\-only files, potentially leading to privilege escalation.
This event helps detect exploitation attempts or similar techniques.
.SS EVENT SETS
\f[B]none\f[R]
.SS DATA FIELDS
.TP
\f[B]inode_in\f[R] (\f[I]uint64\f[R])
The inode number of the input file in the splice operation
.TP
\f[B]in_file_type\f[R] (\f[I]uint16\f[R])
The type of the input file being spliced
.TP
\f[B]in_file_path\f[R] (\f[I]string\f[R])
The path of the input file in the splice operation
