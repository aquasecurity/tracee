.SS NAME
\f[B]io_write\f[R] \- io_uring write operation monitoring
.SS DESCRIPTION
Triggered when a write operation is performed through the io_uring
asynchronous I/O interface.
This event captures write operations submitted via io_uring, providing
detailed information about the file being written, the buffer location,
write size, and position within the file.
.PP
Unlike traditional synchronous writes (vfs_write), io_uring writes are
performed asynchronously, often in kernel worker threads or dedicated
polling threads.
This event properly attributes the write to the original submitting
process, even when the actual write is performed by an io_uring worker
thread, making it valuable for security monitoring and performance
analysis.
.SS EVENT SETS
\f[B]io_uring\f[R]
.SS DATA FIELDS
.TP
\f[B]path\f[R] (\f[I]string\f[R])
The path of the file being written to
.TP
\f[B]pos\f[R] (\f[I]int64\f[R])

The number of bytes to be written
.TP
\f[B]worker_host_tid\f[R] (\f[I]uint32\f[R])
