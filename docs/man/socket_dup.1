.SS NAME
\f[B]socket_dup\f[R] \- socket file descriptor duplication monitoring
.SS DESCRIPTION
Triggered when socket file descriptors are duplicated using the
\f[CR]dup\f[R], \f[CR]dup2\f[R], or \f[CR]dup3\f[R] system calls.
This event specifically monitors the duplication of socket file
descriptors, providing information about socket sharing, inheritance,
and potential network communication patterns.
.PP
Socket duplication is commonly used for process communication, daemon
operations, and network service management, but can also be used in
exploitation techniques and covert communication channels.
.SS EVENT SETS
