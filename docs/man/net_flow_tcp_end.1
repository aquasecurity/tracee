.SS NAME
net_flow_tcp_end \- Event for monitoring the termination of TCP flows
.SS DESCRIPTION
The \f[B]net_flow_tcp_end\f[R] event is derived from base network raw
events and is designed to monitor the termination of TCP flows.
It leverages cgroup skb eBPF programs, focusing specifically on the TCP
protocol\[cq]s termination phase, and is instrumental in analyzing IP
and TCP headers data to detect the end of TCP connections.
.PP
The event utilizes cgroup skb eBPF programs to intercept and analyze raw
network events at the kernel level, with a particular emphasis on the
TCP protocol\[cq]s termination phase.
It processes IP and TCP headers to pinpoint the conclusion of TCP
communication flows.
The event identifies the termination of TCP connections by analyzing the
status of TCP flags, primarily focusing on the FIN and RST flags.
.PP
By examining these flags, the event provides valuable insights into the
end of TCP connections, a critical component for comprehensive network
monitoring and security analysis.

.SS PERFORMANCE CONSIDERATIONS
While designed to minimize system overhead, performance may vary based
on the volume of network traffic and the complexity of monitored TCP
flows.
Efficient data management and analysis are key to leveraging the full
potential of this event without affecting system performance adversely.
