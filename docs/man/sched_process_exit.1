.SS NAME
\f[B]sched_process_exit\f[R] \- process termination scheduler event
.SS DESCRIPTION
Triggered when a process terminates and exits through the kernel\[cq]s
scheduler tracepoint.
This event provides information about the exit status and process
termination details, including the exit code and whether the entire
process group is terminating.
.PP
This event captures process termination at the scheduler level,
providing essential information for tracking process lifecycle,
monitoring process health, and understanding application termination
patterns.
.SS EVENT SETS
\f[B]proc\f[R], \f[B]proc_life\f[R]
.SS DATA FIELDS
.TP
\f[B]exit_code\f[R] (\f[I]int32\f[R])

.TP
\f[B]signal_code\f[R] (\f[I]int32\f[R])
The signal code that caused process termination
.TP
\f[B]process_group_exit\f[R] (\f[I]bool\f[R])
