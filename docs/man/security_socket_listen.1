.SS NAME
\f[B]security_socket_listen\f[R] \- LSM socket listen operation
monitoring
.SS DESCRIPTION
Triggered when the Linux Security Module (LSM) framework performs
security checks on socket listen operations.
This event provides information about sockets being set up to accept
incoming connections, including the socket file descriptor, local
address, and connection backlog.
.PP
This event is crucial for monitoring server\-side network activity and
detecting when processes start listening for incoming connections, which
can indicate service startup or potential security threats.
.SS EVENT SETS
\f[B]lsm_hooks\f[R], \f[B]net\f[R], \f[B]net_sock\f[R]
.SS DATA FIELDS
.TP
\f[B]sockfd\f[R] (\f[I]int32\f[R])
The socket file descriptor being set to listen
.TP
\f[B]local_addr\f[R] (\f[I]SockAddr\f[R])
