.SS NAME
\f[B]task_rename\f[R] \- process name change monitoring
.SS DESCRIPTION
Triggered when a process changes its name through the kernel\[cq]s task
renaming mechanism.
This event captures process name changes that occur when applications
modify their process titles, which can be used for legitimate purposes
such as status indication or potentially for evasion techniques.
.PP
Process name changes are commonly used by daemon processes to indicate
their status, but can also be used by malware to hide their identity or
mimic legitimate processes.
