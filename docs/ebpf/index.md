# Tracee-eBPF: Linux Tracing and Forensics using eBPF

Tracee-eBPF is a lightweight and easy to use tracing tool for Linux, which is focused on security and forensics. It allows you to observe system calls and other system events in real-time, with comprehensive filtering mechanism so you can focus on the events that are relevant to you. Unlike other tracing tools, Tracee, and by extension Tracee-eBPF is a security tool, which is demonstrated by features like capturing forensic artifacts from running applications, tracing non-syscall security events, and producing security insights.
