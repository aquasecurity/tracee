You can obtain Tracee-eBPF in any of the following ways:

1. Download from the [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/aquasecurity/tracee/releases) (`tracee.tar.gz`).
2. Use the docker image from Docker Hub: `aquasec/tracee`.
3. Build the executable from source using `make build`. For that you will need additional development tooling.
4. Build the executable from source in a Docker container which includes all development tooling, using `make build DOCKER=1`.
