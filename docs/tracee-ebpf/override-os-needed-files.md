# Overriding OS needed files

Tracee supports eBPF CO-RE (Compile Once - Run Everywhere) technology and,
because of that, it might need some information about the Linux OS it is
running at. Tracee, through libbpfgo, must have access to /etc/os-release file
AND either /boot/config-$(uname-r) OR /proc/config.gz files (KernelConfig API
at helpers/kernel_config).

> Note that, despite having this need, tracee will try to execute as CO-RE eBPF
> program in any environment it is executed.

## /etc/os-release

Tracee will show you collected information about the running Linux OS with the
`--debug` argument:

```
$ sudo ./dist/tracee-ebpf --debug --trace uid=1000 --trace pid=new --trace event=execve
OSInfo: VERSION_ID: "21.04"
OSInfo: VERSION_CODENAME: hirsute

02:34:43:212623  1000   bash             2787679 2787679 0                execve               pathname: /bin/true, argv: [/bin/true]
```

If, because you're running in a distribution that does not have
/etc/os-release, or because you're running inside a container that does not
support it, you may face:

```
$ sudo ./dist/tracee-ebpf --debug --trace uid=1000 --trace pid=new --trace event=execve
OSInfo: KERNEL_RELEASE: 5.14.0-rc5+
OSInfo: warning: os-release file could be found
(open /etc/os-release: no such file or directory)
BTF: bpfenv = false, btfenv = false, vmlinux = true
BPF: using embedded BPF object

TIME             UID    COMM             PID     TID     RET              EVENT                ARGS
05:37:02:831787  1000   bash             13940   13940   0                execve               pathname: /bin/true, argv: [/bin/true]

End of events stream
Stats: {EventCount:1 ErrorCount:0 LostEvCount:0 LostWrCount:0 LostNtCount:0}
```

But do note that tracee-ebpf shall continue working (informing only the
KERNEL_RELEASE OSInfo option).

If you need to override the underlaying Linux OS information, because you're
running inside a container that already has /etc/os-release file, for example,
you may create another os-release file and inform tracee-ebpf by using
LIBBPFGO's environment variable `LIBBPFGO_OSRELEASE_FILE`:

```
$ sudo LIBBPFGO_OSRELEASE_FILE=/etc/os-release.orig ./dist/tracee-ebpf --debug --trace uid=1000 --trace pid=new --trace event=execve

```

## /proc/config.gz OR /boot/config-$(uname -r)

Tracee needs access to kconfig file in order to:

1. Check if the kernel of your running environment supports needed eBPF features
2. Provide kconfig variables to its eBPF counter-part (so eBPF program take decisions)

Tracee should NOT fail when it cannot find a kconfig file:

```
$ sudo ./dist/tracee-ebpf --debug --trace uid=1000 --trace pid=new --trace event=execve
KConfig: warning: could not check enabled kconfig features
(could not read /boot/config-5.14.0-rc5+: stat /boot/config-5.14.0-rc5+: no such file or directory)

OSInfo: VERSION_ID: "21.10"
OSInfo: VERSION: "21.10 (Impish Indri)"

BTF: bpfenv = false, btfenv = false, vmlinux = true

TIME             UID    COMM             PID     TID     RET              EVENT                ARGS
05:44:18:877838  1000   bash             14089   14089   0                execve               pathname: /bin/true, argv: [/bin/true]
```

but do have in mind it is assuming some things from the host environment and
its behavior might have inconsistencies.

If you are running tracee in an environment that does not have a kconfig file
(nor /proc/config.gz support), it is recommended that you provide the host
kconfig file location to tracee through the `LIBBPFGO_KCONFIG_FILE` environment
variable:

```
$ sudo LIBBPFGO_KCONFIG_FILE=/boot/config-5.14.0-rc5+.orig ./dist/tracee-ebpf --debug --trace uid=1000 --trace pid=new --trace event=execve
OSInfo: VERSION_CODENAME: impish

05:47:45:245869  1000   bash             14165   14165   0                execve               pathname: /bin/true, argv: [/bin/true]
```

## ATTENTION: in case kconfig file is NOT found

In case no kconfig file is found, tracee takes some decisions blindly and it
may give you unexpected errors. Example:

```
$ sudo ./dist/tracee-ebpf --debug --trace uid=1000 --trace pid=new --trace event=execve
KConfig: warning: could not check enabled kconfig features
(could not read /boot/config-5.14.0-rc5+: stat /boot/config-5.14.0-rc5+: no such file or directory)
OSInfo: PRETTY_NAME: "Ubuntu Impish Indri (development branch)"
OSInfo: VERSION_ID: "21.10"
OSInfo: VERSION: "21.10 (Impish Indri)"
OSInfo: VERSION_CODENAME: impish
OSInfo: ID: ubuntu
OSInfo: ID_LIKE: debian
OSInfo: KERNEL_RELEASE: 5.14.0-rc5+
BTF: bpfenv = false, btfenv = false, vmlinux = true
BPF: using embedded BPF object
unpacked CO:RE bpf object file into memory
TIME             UID    COMM             PID     TID     RET              EVENT                ARGS
05:50:53:742705  1000   bash             14244   14244   0                execve               pathname:  , argv: []
```

In this example tracee has assumed the environment had
`CONFIG_ARCH_HAS_SYSCALL_WRAPPER=y` kconfig option set but that wasn't the
case. It led tracee not to be able to get syscalls arguments correctly.
