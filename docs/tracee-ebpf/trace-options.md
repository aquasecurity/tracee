# Trace Options

Trace output can easily become unwieldy when tracing all of the events from all of the system. Luckily, Tracee has a powerful mechanism to accurately trace just the information that is relevant to you, using the `--trace` flag.
Using the `--trace` you define expressions that tells Tracee-eBPF what you are interested in by means of event metadata, and process metadata. Only events that match this criteria will be traced.

You can filter by most of the visible fields on a Tracee event. For example to trace only events related to user ID 1000, use `--trace uid=1000`.  
You can combine trace expressions into more complex criteria. For example, to trace only events related to user ID 1000, which come from process ID 1234, use `--trace uid=1000 --trace pid=1234`.  

A special `pid` value is `new` which let's you trace all newly created processes (that were created after Tracee started tracing).  
Tracee-eBPF lets you easily trace events that originate in containers using `--trace container` or only new containers (that were created after Tracee started) using `--trace container=new`.

Event metadata can be used in trace expression as well. For example, to trace only `openat` syscalls, use `--trace event:openat`. But you can also filter on a specific argument of the event, e.g `--trace openat.pathname=/bin/ls` which will show only `openat` syscalls that operate on the file `/bin/ls`.

A useful trace mode is the `--trace follow` which, if specified, will trace not only processes that match the given trace expressions, but also their child processes.
For example, the following will trace all the events that originate from zsh shell, including all of the processes that it will spawn: `--trace command=zsh --follow`.

## CLI Options

Only events that match all trace expressions will be traced (trace flags are ANDed).
The following types of expressions are supported:

Numerical expressions which compare numbers and allow the following operators: '=', '!=', '<', '>'.
Available numerical expressions: uid, pid, mntns, pidns.

String expressions which compares text and allow the following operators: '=', '!='.
Available string expressions: event, set, uts, comm.

Boolean expressions that check if a boolean is true and allow the following operator: '!'.
Available boolean expressions: container.

Event arguments can be accessed using 'event_name.event_arg' and provide a way to filter an event by its arguments.
Event arguments allow the following operators: '=', '!='.
Strings can be compared as a prefix if ending with '*'.

Event return value can be accessed using 'event_name.retval' and provide a way to filter an event by its return value.
Event return value expression has the same syntax as a numerical expression.

Non-boolean expressions can compare a field to multiple values separated by ','.
Multiple values are ORed if used with equals operator '=', but are ANDed if used with any other operator.

The field 'container' and 'pid' also support the special value 'new' which selects new containers or pids, respectively.

The field 'set' selects a set of events to trace according to predefined sets, which can be listed by using the 'list' flag.

The special 'follow' expression declares that not only processes that match the criteria will be traced, but also their descendants.

Note: some of the above operators have special meanings in different shells. To 'escape' those operators, please use single quotes, e.g.: 'uid>0'

## Examples

```
--trace pid=new
```

```
--trace p=510 --trace p=1709
```

only trace events from newly created containers

```
--trace container=new
```

only trace events from containers

```
--trace container
```

only trace events from containers (same as above)

```
--trace c
```
