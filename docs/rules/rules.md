Rules are discovered from the local `rules` directory (unless changed by the `--rules-dir` flag). By default, all discovered rules will be loaded unless specific rules are selected using the `--rules` flag.

## Authoring Rules
Tracee-Rules supports authoring rules in [Golang](../go) or in [Rego](../rego) (the language of Open Policy Agent).
