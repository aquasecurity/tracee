# Creating Tracee Container Images

> These instructions are meant to describe how to build the official tracee
> containers images, instead of just downloading them from the

## Tracee Flavors

Tracee container images come in **2 flavors**:

1. **tracee:latest** (sometimes called "slim")

    Contains an executable binary with an embedded and CO-RE enabled eBPF object
    that makes it portable against multiple Linux and kernel versions.

2. **tracee:full**

    Contains tracee source tree, and required toolchain, in order to, during the
    startup time, compile a non CO-RE eBPF object, to your specific running
    Linux kernel , and make the executable to use it on execution time.

## Using Tracee Containers from the Docker Hub

Before moving on to how to build Tracee containers, it is important to know the
published container images and their tag meanings. Here is the current list of
docker container images being published during a release:

1. **SNAPSHOT (development) container images:**

     These container images are built daily and its tags always point to the latest
     daily built container images (based on the version currently being developed).

     - **aquasec/tracee:dev** (arch: amd64, portable)
     - **aquasec/tracee:dev-full** (arch: amd64, portable & on-demand build)

     Multiple architecture tags:

     - **aquasec/tracee:x86_64-dev**  (arch: amd64, portable)
     - **aquasec/tracee:aarch64-dev** (arch: amd64, portable)

     - **aquasec/tracee:x86_64-dev-full** (arch: amd64, portable & on-demand build)
     - **aquasec/tracee:aarch64-dev-full** (arch: amd64, portable & on-demand build)

2. **RELEASE (official versions) container images:**

     Preferable aliases for latest released images (last release):

     - **aquasec/tracee:x86_64** (arch: amd64, portable)
     - **aquasec/tracee:x86_64-full** (arch: amd64, portable & on-demand build)

     From v0.13.0 and on (arm64 support):

     - **aquasec/tracee:aarch64** (arch: amd64, portable)
     - **aquasec/tracee:aarch64-full** (arch: amd64, portable & on-demand build)

     These container images exist for each released version of Tracee:

     - **aquasec/tracee:x86_64-VERSION** (arch: amd64, portable)
     - **aquasec/tracee:x86_64-VERSION-full** (arch: amd64, portable & on-demand build)

     From v0.13.0 and on (arm64 support):

     - **aquasec/tracee:aarch64-VERSION** (arch: amd64, portable)
     - **aquasec/tracee:aarch64-VERSION-full** (arch: amd64, portable & on-demand build)

## Generating Tracee Containers

1. **tracee:latest**

    ```text
    $ BTFHUB={0,1} make -f builder/Makefile.tracee-container build-tracee
    ```

2. **tracee:full**

    ```text
    $ BTFHUB={0,1} make -f builder/Makefile.tracee-container build-tracee-full
    ```

    !!! Note
        `BTFHUB=1` adds support to some [older kernels](https://github.com/aquasecurity/btfhub/blob/main/docs/supported-distros.md)
        so user doesn't need to build specific non CO-RE eBPF objects to them.

## Running Generated Tracee Containers

Containers are supposed to be executed through docker cmdline directly, from
the official built images. Nevertheless, during the image building process, it
may be useful to execute them with correct arguments to see if they're
working.

User may execute built containers through `Makefile.tracee-container` file with
the "run" targets:

1. To run the **tracee:latest** container:

    ```text
    $ make -f builder/Makefile.tracee-container run-tracee
    ```

2. To run the **tracee:full** container:

    ```text
    $ make -f builder/Makefile.tracee-container run-tracee-full
    ```

    !!! note
        Tracee-ebpf arguments are passed through the `ARG` variable:
        ```text
        $ make -f builder/Makefile.tracee-container run-tracee ARG="--help"
        ```

## Running Tracee-eBPF Only

Generated containers allow user to run Tracee, as a complete security solution
(**tracee-ebpf** passes events to **tracee-rules** and **tracee-rules** process
events based on existing security signatures) or to run **tracee-ebpf** only,
as an introspection tool.

1. To run the `tracee:latest` container with **tracee-ebpf** only:

   ```text
   $ make -f builder/Makefile.tracee-container run-tracee-ebpf
   ```

2. To run the `tracee:full` container with **tracee-ebpf** only:

   ```text
   $ make -f builder/Makefile.tracee-container run-tracee-ebpf-full
   ```

!!! note
    Tracee-ebpf arguments are passed through the `ARG` variable:

    ```text
    $ make -f builder/Makefile.tracee-container run-tracee-ebpf ARG="--log debug"
    ```
