# syncfs

## Intro
 syncfs - synchronize all file system data on the device associated with a file descriptor

## Description
The syncfs() system call synchronizes all data associated with the device opened via the file descriptor fd. It calls the file system's sync() operation, which transfers all cached data to permanent storage, and then the fsync() call. This is typically used to ensure that everything written to a file by the application is really on permanent storage.

syncfs() is similar to sync(), but applies only to the filesystem associated with the file descriptor fd.

## Arguments
* `fd`:`int`[K] - file descriptor pointing to a filesystem device.

### Available Tags
* K - Originated from kernel-space.
* U - Originated from user space (for example, pointer to user space memory used to get it)
* TOCTOU - Vulnerable to TOCTOU (time of check, time of use)
* OPT - Optional argument - might not always be available (passed with null value)

## Hooks

#### Type

#### Purpose
Used to synchronize all data associated with a filesystem device.

## Example Use Case
Let's say you wanted to take a backup of a file system in a file descriptor. The syncfs() system call is the one to do this, as it transfers all cached data to permanent storage.

## Issues
None.
