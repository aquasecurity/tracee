# rt_sigpending

## Intro
rt_sigpending - examine a pending signal mask

## Description
The rt_sigpending() system call asks the kernel to store the currently pending
signal set for the calling process in the location pointed to by `set`. The
`sigsetsize` argument specifies the size (in bytes) of the memory pointed to by
`set`.

The purpose of this system call is to allow applications to examine the set of
signals which are currently blocked for the caller's execution. This could be
useful for synchronizing processes waiting on signals, or to simply query their
signal state.

There are some edge cases or drawbacks to using rt_sigpending, particularly with
regard to thread-safe signal handling. If the signal set in `set` is not
protected by a mutex or other thread-safe mechanisms, multiple threads may race
to modify the signal set and cause unexpected results. Furthermore, the kernel
may not be able to accurately detect any pending signals if an application
handles them with a signal handler, as the pending signals may be consumed before
the kernel can list them.

## Arguments
* `set`:`sigset_t*`[U] - pointer to a sigset_t type in user space.
* `sigsetsize`:`size_t`[K] - The size of the `set` argument in bytes.

### Available Tags
* K - Originated from kernel-space.
* U - Originated from user space (for example, pointer to user space memory used to get it)
* TOCTOU - Vulnerable to TOCTOU (time of check, time of use)
* OPT - Optional argument - might not always be available (passed with null value)

## Hooks
### do_rt_sigpending
#### Type
Kprobe
#### Purpose
The do_rt_sigpending() function is the kernel entry point for the rt_sigpending system call. It is responsible for copying the set of pending signals for the calling process into the location pointed to by `set`. It is hooked with a Kprobe to provide userspace visibility into the details of pending signal sets.

## Example Use Case
An example use case for rt_sigpending() is to query the current blocked signal set of the calling process. This is useful to synchronize processes waiting on signals, or to simply query the process's blocked signal state.

## Issues
No issues have been identified with the rt_sigpending system call.
