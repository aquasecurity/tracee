# geteuid

## Intro
geteuid - Retrieve the effective user ID.

## Description
geteuid is a syscall used to retrieve the effective user ID of the current process. This value is used by the kernel when determining which operations are allowed to be executed by the current process. It can be used to enforce access control policies.

The geteuid syscall does not take any parameters, which makes it simpler to use than other syscalls. However, it is important to note that the effective user ID may be different from the real user ID, as the kernel may allow certain processes to temporarily execute in a different user context.
