# lock

## Intro
lock -  locks a file or an entire filesystem.

## Description
The *lock* syscall is used to set, reset or test for the presence of a lock on a file or an entire filesystem. It can be used to prevent concurrent access to a file by multiple processes. When a lock is set, other processes are prevented from accessing the file until the lock is released. The lock allows synchronizing the access to the file and this may improve performance if multiple processes need to use the same data. However, the *lock* syscall itself prevents the access to a file and should be used only when absolutely necessary, otherwise it can cause performance degradation and even deadlocks. 

## Arguments
* `fd`:`int`[K] - a file descriptor that must be open for reading or writing
* `cmd`:`int`[K] - specifies the operation to be performed. This can be `F_SETLK`, `F_SETLKW` or `F_GETLK`
* `lock`:`struct flock`[K] - points to a `struct flock` which contains the members `l_type`, `l_whence`, `l_start`, `l_len` and `l_pid`. 

### Available Tags
* K - Originated from kernel-space.

## Hooks
### do_fcntl
#### Type
Kprobes
#### Purpose
The kernel function *do_fcntl* is the entry point for the *fcntl* syscall, one of the primary system calls for file control. Specifically, it handles the *lock* operation, which is used for locking files and filesystems.

## Example Use Case
The *lock* syscall can be used to ensure file access by multiple processes is mutually exclusive and can improve performance when working with the same data.

## Issues
If the lock is not properly released, due to a crash or program being terminated, it can cause a deadlock and all following processes will be blocked.

* fcntl - gathers generic information about the *fcntl* syscall.
* read - triggers when a number of bytes was read from a file descriptor.
* write - triggers when a number of bytes was written to a file descriptor.
