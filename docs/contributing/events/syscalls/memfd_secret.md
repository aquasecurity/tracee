# memfd_secret

## Intro
memfd_secret - creates an anonymous file backed by memory, with the ability
to lock a portion of the file.

## Description
The memfd_secret() system call creates a file descriptor that refers to an
anonymous, in-memory file. It differs from memfd_create() in that it has a
secret option, which allows a portion of the file to be locked in memory,
preventing it from being swapped to disk. This can be useful for sensitive
data, such as cryptographic key material, which should not be written to
persistent storage.

The `flags` argument determines how the file is created, and is a bitmask of
permission bits. It can be used to control whether read and write operations
are allowed on the file.

## Arguments
* `flags`: `unsigned int`[K] - bitmask of permission bits to control whether read and write operations are allowed on the file.

### Available Tags
* K - Originated from kernel-space.

## Hooks
### memfd_secret
#### Type
Kprobe
#### Purpose
To monitor and log when the system call is called.

## Example Use Case
This system call can be used to create a file that is stored in memory, with the ability to lock a portion of the file. This could be used to store sensitive data, such as cryptographic keys, preventing it from being written to persistent storage.

## Issues
