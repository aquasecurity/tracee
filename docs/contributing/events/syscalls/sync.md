# sync

## Intro
sync - waits until all disk write operations have been completed

## Description
The sync command causes all in-memory modified blocks to be written to disk. This is useful in order to ensure the full integrality and consistency of the data in the case of a system crash or power failure. However, it is not a full backup solution and it should be used in combination with other data safety measures. Moreover, regular synchronization of the disks is suggested in order to minimize the impact of unclean shutdown.

## Arguments
* `None`

## Hooks
### sync_file_range
#### Type
Kprobes
#### Purpose
Detecting when a process is syncing files to create a superblock barrier.

### sys_sync
#### Type
Kprobes
#### Purpose
Detecting calls to the sys_sync function in the kernel.

## Example Use Case
For example, the sync command can be used to make sure that the in-memory modified blocks are written to disk before rebooting the system.

## Issues
Depending on the file system used, the sync command doesn't guarantee that the data is flushed completely.
