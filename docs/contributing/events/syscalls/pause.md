# Pause

## Intro
Pause - pauses the calling process until a signal is received.

## Description
The pause() system call suspends the calling process until one of its child process terminates or a signal is received. If any of the currently pending signals have SIGCONT set as its action, pause() returns immediately. Any function that do not have SIGCONT as its action will suspend the process until a signal occurs.

The pause() system call is used to synchronize a process with its child processes, so that when a child terminates, the parent can be notified. It is also used to temporarily suspend a process while signals are handled.

## Arguments
* None.

## Hooks
### do_sys_pause
#### Type
Kprobes
#### Purpose
The do_sys_pause() function is the kernel entry point for the pause system call. Kprobes is used to hook this function to record system call parameters.

## Example Use Case
The pause() system call could be used for throttling the current process before it runs a task.

## Issues
The pause() system call fails if any of the pending signals have SIGCONT as its action.
