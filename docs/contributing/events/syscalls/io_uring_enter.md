## Intro 
io_uring_enter - a system call that submits and optionally waits on a set of I/O operations

## Description
The io_uring_enter system call allows processes to perform I/O operations and optionally wait for their completion. This call combines the submission of a set of I/O operations with the ability to wait on them without making additional system calls. The operations used to fulfill the request are submitted via an io_uring instance associated with the process. The number of operations submitted is given in the *to_submit* argument and is expected to be a positive integer. 

The *min_complete* argument tells the system how many I/O operations need to be completed (or failed) before returning from the io_uring_enter call. This value is also expected to be a positive integer, or zero, if the caller is not interested in waiting on individual I/O completion events. The *flags* argument is a bitmask of flags that modify the caller's request. The flags can be used to indicate if I/O operations should remain in the submission queue on error, if any registered buffers can be safely reused without the caller double-checking their contents, or if the caller should be woken up if any operation within their submission set completes or fails. 

The *sig* argument contains a pointer to a signal set that may be used to unblock system calls being waited on. If set to NULL, the behavior will be the same as that of a call to io_uring_enter without a signal set.

## Arguments
* `fd`:`unsigned int`Â - file descriptor associated with the io_uring instance used to submit I/O requests.
* `to_submit`:`unsigned int`[OPT] - the number of I/O requests to submit. 
* `min_complete`:`unsigned int`[OPT] - the number of I/O requests that need to be completed before io_uring_enter returns.
* `flags`:`unsigned int`[OPT] - flags modifying the request submission and completion.
* `sig`:`sigset_t*`[U] - pointer to a signal set that may unblock system calls.

### Available Tags
* K - Originated from kernel-space.
* U - Originated from user space (in this case, the sig argument is a pointer to a signal set located in user space).
* OPT - Optional argument - might not always be available (passed with null value)

## Hooks
### io_uring_enter
#### Type
Kprobe + Ringbuffer 
#### Purpose
To monitor the submission and completion of I/O operations.

## Example Use Case
A use case for the io_uring_enter system call could be in an application that needs to monitor the status of a large number of I/O operations. This application could submit requests using the io_uring system and then use the io_uring_enter system call to wait on their completion, without the need to make additional system calls. 

## Issues
The signal set passed to io_uring_enter is potentially vulnerable to a time of check to time of use (TOCTOU) attack if an unprivileged process can manipulate it before the system call is made.

## Related Events
The io_uring_submit and io_uring_wait system calls are related to, and should be used in conjunction with, io_uring_enter.
