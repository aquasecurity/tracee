# io_destroy

## Intro
'io_destroy' - destroys an io_context.

## Description
The io_destroy() system call function is used to destroy the io_context structure and free operation associated with it. The io_context structure may be freed after all operations have finished executing. The return value specified the remaining number of IO contexts associated with this context_fd number. 

Generally this syscall is useful when multiple threads, or processes, require service from an asynchronous IO context and the context needs to be destroyed once the operations have completed. It's also possible to use this call with a NULL context_fd, which will temporarily suspend all operations associated with the current context.

## Arguments
* `ctx_id`:`io_context_t`[KU] - a pointer to an existing io context structure. 

### Available Tags
* K - Originated from kernel-space.
* U - Originated from user space (for example, pointer to user space memory used to get it)
