# umask

## Intro
umask - set file mode creation mask

## Description
The umask system call sets the calling process's file mode creation mask (umask) to `mask` and returns the previous value of the mask.
The umask is used to determine the file permission bits of newly created files. A process calls umask before creating new files and directories with the intention that files will be created with the specified mode. The mode argument is bitwise-ANDed with the complement of the file mode creation mask of the process (as returned by a call to umask) to turn off specified bits in the file permission, thus restricting the permissions of newly-created files.

UMask is designed to be used in a secure way to ensure that no unintended consequences arise due to unexpected permissions. It should not be used to relax constraints. Allowing a process to execute arbitrary external code with arbitrary permissions is a security risk.

## Arguments
* `mask`:`mode_t`[K] - The new file mode creation mask, or 0 for no change. The bit pattern of the mask is CNMSFU, where S is the set-user-ID and F is the set-group-ID permission bit.

### Available Tags
* K - Originated from kernel-space.

## Hooks
### sys_umask
#### Type
Tracepoint.
#### Purpose
Tracking the umask modifications of a process over time.

## Example Use Case
Umask can be used to monitor changes to the file mode creation mask of a process. It can be used to ensure that the process is only setting the file mode creation mask to pre-defined values, and that no unintended consequences arise due to unexpected permissions.

## Issues
Using umask to relax constraints can be a security risk. Allowing a process to execute arbitrary external code with arbitrary permissions is a breach of security.
