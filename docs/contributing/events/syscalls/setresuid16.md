# setresuid16

## Intro
setresuid16 - set real, effective and saved user identity

## Description
The setresuid16 syscall sets the effective, real, and saved user identities
depending on the value of the argument flags. A process with the CAP_SETUID
capability can set its own user ID's. A process without the CAP_SETUID
capability can set the real and effective user ID's to the effective user ID of
the process. All the ID's are changed regardless of the value of the flags
argument, so group and supplemental group changes can not be suppressed.

## Arguments
* `ruid`:`old_uid_t`[K] - real user ID
* `euid`:`old_uid_t`[K] - effective user ID
* `suid`:`old_uid_t`[K] - saved set-user-ID

### Available Tags
* K - Originated from kernel-space.
