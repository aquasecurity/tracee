# getsid

## Intro
getsid - get the session ID of a process

## Description
getsid() returns the session ID of the process specified in pid. If pid is zero, the  call applies to the calling process.  If pid is not a member of the current  session, getsid() returns -1 and sets errno to ESRCH. The current session ID is  determined by a call to getsid() for the process specified in pid equal to 0.

## Arguments
* `pid`:`pid_t` - the PID of the process whose session ID will be returned.

#### Purpose
Enable more fine-grained tracing in the user and system level by tracing 
through the process executed code.

## Example Use Case
Example of a use case for getsid would be implementing a process that 
replaces the current session's leader process with a new one, or getting 
the PID and session ID of newly created processes to ensure they were not 
orphaned.

## Issues
It needs to be monitored carefully when using getsid() on processes that 
do not belong to the calling processâ€™s session in order to prevent malicious 
actions such as hijacking of processes running in different sessions.
