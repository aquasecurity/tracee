# Setup Development Machine with Vagrant

[HashiCorp Vagrant] leverages a declarative configuration file, which describes
all software requirements, packages, operating system configuration, and users
to provide the same development environment for everyone.

The [Vagrantfile](https://github.com/aquasecurity/tracee/blob/main/Vagrantfile) describes a cross-platform QEMU-based virtual machine optimized for building Tracee from the [Getting Started](../index.md) guides. It supports both Linux and macOS hosts with hardware acceleration for optimal performance.

This allows developers involved in the project to check out the code, run `vagrant up`, and be on their way with a fully configured [cloud-image/ubuntu-24.04] development environment.

## Features

- **Cross-platform support**: Linux (KVM) and macOS (HVF) with automatic hardware acceleration detection
- **Optimized shared folders**: Platform-specific 9p filesystem implementation for best performance
- **Flexible configuration**: Easily customize CPU, memory, and acceleration settings
- **Automatic error handling**: Comprehensive validation and user-friendly error messages

## Prerequisites

- [HashiCorp Vagrant]
- [QEMU] with hardware acceleration support:
  - **Linux**: KVM acceleration (recommended for optimal performance)
  - **macOS**: HVF (Hypervisor Framework) acceleration on Intel/Apple Silicon
  - **Fallback**: TCG software emulation (slower but works on all systems)
- [vagrant-qemu plugin]: Install with `vagrant plugin install vagrant-qemu`

## Clone the Tracee Repository

Clone the Tracee repository to your local machine. This repository contains the Vagrantfile.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aquasecurity/tracee.git
```

## Navigate to the Tracee Directory

Open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing the `Vagrantfile` within the cloned Tracee repository (`tracee/`)

```bash
cd tracee
```

## Configure VM Type (Optional)

The VM can be provisioned for either a `dev` or `test` environment. The `dev` environment includes additional tools like MicroK8s, kubectl, and Helm.

- **Development Environment:** Full development environment (Default)

  ```bash
  export VM_TYPE=dev
  ```

- **Testing Environment:**  Smaller vagrant machine without k8s cumbersome to avoid conflicts with specific tests.

  ```bash
  export VM_TYPE=test
  ```

**Important:** There are two ways to use a custom `VM_TYPE`:

**Option 1: Export the environment variable (recommended)**
```bash
# Export once, then use normal vagrant commands
export VM_TYPE=test
vagrant up
vagrant ssh
vagrant halt
vagrant destroy
```

**Option 2: Prefix each command (if not exported)**
```bash
# Include VM_TYPE in every command if not exported
VM_TYPE=test vagrant up
VM_TYPE=test vagrant ssh
VM_TYPE=test vagrant halt
VM_TYPE=test vagrant destroy
```

Without setting `VM_TYPE`, vagrant defaults to the `dev` environment. If you use the prefix method (Option 2) and forget to include `VM_TYPE` in a command, vagrant may operate on the wrong VM or give "VM not found" errors.

> **ðŸ’¡ Tip**: Use `export VM_TYPE=test` at the beginning of your session to avoid repeating it in every command.

## Configure VM Settings (Optional)

Customize the VM's configuration by setting the following environment variables:

### Resource Allocation

- `VM_CPUS`: Number of virtual processors. Defaults to half of the host's processors. Example:

  ```bash
  export VM_CPUS=4
  ```

- `VM_MEM`: Memory in gigabytes. Defaults to 8GB. Example:

  ```bash
  export VM_MEM=16
  ```

### Hardware Acceleration

- `VM_ACCEL`: Force specific acceleration type. Options vary by host OS:

  **Linux:**
  ```bash
  export VM_ACCEL=kvm   # KVM acceleration (fast)
  export VM_ACCEL=tcg   # Software emulation (slow)
  ```

  **macOS:**
  ```bash
  export VM_ACCEL=hvf   # HVF acceleration (fast)
  export VM_ACCEL=tcg   # Software emulation (slow)
  ```

  If not specified, the optimal acceleration method is automatically detected.

## Start the VM

### Basic Usage

Run the following command to start the VM with default settings:

```bash
vagrant up
```

### Custom Configuration Examples

You can combine environment variables for custom configurations:

```bash
# Test VM with custom resources
VM_TYPE=test VM_CPUS=4 VM_MEM=4 vagrant up

# Force software emulation (useful for troubleshooting)
VM_ACCEL=tcg vagrant up

# High-performance development VM
VM_TYPE=dev VM_CPUS=8 VM_MEM=16 vagrant up
```

### Changing Acceleration After VM Creation

To change hardware acceleration, you must halt and restart the VM:

```bash
# Switch to software emulation
vagrant halt && VM_ACCEL=tcg vagrant up

# Switch back to hardware acceleration (Linux)
vagrant halt && VM_ACCEL=kvm vagrant up

# Switch back to hardware acceleration (macOS)
vagrant halt && VM_ACCEL=hvf vagrant up
```

**Note:** `vagrant reload` does NOT apply acceleration changes.

Vagrant will download the [cloud-image/ubuntu-24.04] base box, provision the VM, and install all required dependencies including clang19. This process may take some time on first run.

## Accessing the VM

Once the VM is up and running, you can access it via SSH:

```bash
vagrant ssh
```

This will place you in the `/vagrant` directory inside the VM, which is synced with the Tracee directory on your host machine.

### Shared Folder Implementation

The VM uses a sophisticated shared folder system that varies by host OS:

- **Linux**: Direct 9p mount with UID/GID mapping for optimal performance
- **macOS**: 9p + bindfs overlay for proper ownership mapping

**Performance Note for macOS users:** File operations may be slower due to the bindfs overlay. For large Git operations or extensive file processing, consider running them outside the VM.

## Build and Run Tracee

You can now build Tracee within the VM using the provided Makefile. Consult the Tracee documentation for specific build instructions.
[Building Tracee Documentation](./building/building.md)

## Stopping the VM

To stop the VM, use:

  ```bash
  vagrant halt
  ```

## Destroying the VM

To completely remove the VM, use:

  ```bash
  vagrant destroy
  ```

## Troubleshooting

### Hardware Acceleration Issues

**KVM not available (Linux):**
```bash
# Check if KVM is supported
ls /dev/kvm
# If missing, enable virtualization in BIOS/UEFI
# Install KVM packages:
sudo apt install qemu-kvm libvirt-daemon-system
```

**HVF not available (macOS):**
```bash
# Check if HVF is supported
sysctl -n kern.hv_support
# Ensure you're on macOS 10.10+ with Intel CPU or Apple Silicon
```

**Fallback to software emulation:**
If hardware acceleration is not available, the VM automatically falls back to TCG software emulation. This is slower but functional.

### Shared Folder Issues

**Files not visible in `/vagrant`:**
```bash
# Check mount status inside VM
mount | grep vagrant

# For Linux hosts - check direct 9p mount
mount | grep 9p

# For macOS hosts - check bindfs mount
mount | grep bindfs
```

**Permission issues (macOS):**
```bash
# Inside VM, check ownership
ls -la /vagrant

# Should show vagrant:vagrant (1000:1000)
# If not, check systemd mount services (macOS hosts):
sudo systemctl status mnt-shared.mount
sudo systemctl status vagrant.mount
```

### Performance Issues

**Slow file operations (macOS):**
- This is expected due to bindfs overlay
- Consider running large operations outside VM
- Use Git inside VM for better performance with large repositories

**VM performance is slow:**
- Ensure hardware acceleration is enabled
- Check: `vagrant ssh` then `cat /proc/cpuinfo | grep flags` for virtualization features
- Increase VM resources: `VM_CPUS=8 VM_MEM=16 vagrant up`

### Network and Port Issues

**Port conflicts:**
```bash
# Check actual forwarded ports
vagrant ssh-config
ps aux | grep qemu-system | grep hostfwd
```

**SSH connection issues:**
```bash
# Force VM restart
vagrant halt --force && vagrant up

# Check VM status
vagrant status
```

### General Issues

**VM stuck or unresponsive:**
```bash
# Force halt and restart
vagrant halt --force
vagrant up
```

**Provisioning failures:**
```bash
# Re-run provisioning
vagrant provision

# Or destroy and recreate
vagrant destroy -f && vagrant up
```

**QEMU/plugin issues:**
```bash
# Ensure vagrant-qemu plugin is installed
vagrant plugin list | grep qemu

# Reinstall if needed
vagrant plugin uninstall vagrant-qemu
vagrant plugin install vagrant-qemu
