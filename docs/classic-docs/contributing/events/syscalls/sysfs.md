# sysfs

## Intro
sysfs - a system call for managing and querying the Linux kernel's sysfs file system.

## Description
sysfs is a filesystem used by the Linux kernel to export information about devices and driver configuration options. It is used by user space applications to read and write configuration and device-specific data. sysfs is read-only from user space and is used to query the kernel for system parameters such as CPU and memory size. It also provides access to shared kernel trace information and can be used to access procfs.

The sysfs system call allows user space processes to read and write sysfs entries. It takes an option as an argument which specifies the action to be performed. The optional argument is of type `int` and is read-only.

## Arguments
* `option`:`int`[K] - specifies the action to be performed by the sysfs system call.

### Available Tags
* K - Originated from kernel-space.

## Hooks
The `sysfs` system call is not hooked. 
 
## Example Use Case
The sysfs system call is typically used to query kernel parameters and device-specific data. This allows user-space programs to get information about the devices and drivers supported by the kernel without having to know any kernel-specific details.

For instance, if a program needs to determine the size of the physical memory installed in a system, it can call sysfs with the `option` set to `MEM_SIZE` and the kernel will return the size of the memory in bytes.

## Issues
None.
