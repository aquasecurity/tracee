# ssetmask

## Intro
ssetmask - Change calling thread signal mask

## Description
The ssetmask function sets the signal mask of the calling thread to the argument newmask, and returns the previous signal mask of the thread. The calls have no effect on signals that are ignored. The ssetmask() function is equivalent to sigprocmask(2).

## Arguments
* `newmask`:`long`[K] - The signal mask to be set.

### Available Tags
* K - Originated from kernel-space.
* U - Originated from user space (for example, pointer to user space memory used to get it)
* TOCTOU - Vulnerable to TOCTOU (time of check, time of use)
* OPT - Optional argument - might not always be available (passed with null value)

## Hooks
### ssetmask
#### Type
Kprobes
#### Purpose
To detect when threads change their signal masks.

## Example Use Case
ssetmask() can be used to detect if a thread is attempting to block certain signals. This is useful to detect certain malicious activities, as it can indicate the presence of signal handlers.

## Issues
None
