# creat

## Intro
creat - system call to create a new, or overwrite an existing, file with certain permissions

## Description
The creat() syscall creates a new file or overwrites an existing file, in the file system pointed to by the given pathname, with the given permissions. If the file does not exist, it will be created with the given permissions. If the file does exist, it will be overwritten, and set to the given permissions.

It should be noted that the creat() syscall is essentially the same as using the open() syscall with the O_CREAT and O_WRONLY flags.

## Arguments
* `pathname`:`const char*` - a pointer to a string containing the path to file being modified.
* `mode`:`mode_t` - permissions to be applied to the file.

### Available Tags
* U - Originated from user space (for example, pointer to user space memory used to get it)

## Hooks

#### Type

#### Purpose
To observe and trace when the creat() system call is performed.

## Example Use Case
A logging system which keeps track of when files are created or modified.

## Issues
When creating a file, there is an atomic race condition which could lead to the file being left in an unexpected state if the creat() syscall fails and the file is overwritten.
