# iopl

## Intro
iopl - set the I/O privilege level of the current process

## Description
The `iopl` syscall sets the I/O privilege level of the current process. It allows a process to have access to I/O port addresses that would otherwise be unavailable. It requires supervisor privileges to execute. If the argument is 0, the I/O privilege level of the current process is set to 0, disabling I/O port access. 

The I/O privilege level is a construct used by some operating systems that allow for a higher level of control when performing input/output operations. The idea is that certain restricted operations can only be performed by processes that have been granted supervisory privileges.

There are several drawbacks to using `iopl`, such as system instability and security risks. Since the caller has full access to the I/O ports, they could gain unauthorized access, modify or remove critical data, or cause the system to crash.

## Arguments
* `level`:`int`[K] - the privilege level the current process should be set to. If the argument is 0, all I/O port access for the current process is disabled.

### Available Tags
* K - Originated from kernel-space.

## Hooks
### sys_iopl
#### Type
Kprobes
#### Purpose
To capture and monitor calls to the `iopl` syscall, and the arguments passed to it. 

## Example Use Case
The `iopl` syscall can be used by security moniroting applications to detect attempts to set the I/O privilege level, and log the corresponding information.

## Issues
This syscall is not available on all architectures. Furthermore, it cannot be used on kernel versions before 4.7.
