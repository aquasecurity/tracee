# shmdt

## Intro
shmdt - detach a shared memory segment from the caller's data segment

## Description
The `shmdt()` syscall detached a shared memory segment from the caller's data
segment. It shall be used after a shared memory segment is no longer needed.
When a shared memory segment is attached, it becomes part of the address
space of the calling process, and the calling process must explicitly
detach it. An `shmdt()` call destroys the association between the process
and the shared memory segment. If a process has multiple shared memory
attachments, each must be detached individually.

When the last process detaches a segment, the segment is deleted and its
resources are returned to the system. If a segment is detached while
processes still have the segment attached, the state of the segment
persists until all processes have detached it.

## Arguments
* `shmaddr`:`const void*`[K] - pointer to the shared memory segment.

### Available Tags
* K - Originated from kernel-space.

## Hooks
### shmdt
#### Type
Kprobe 
#### Purpose
The `shmdt()` syscall is used to detach a shared memory segment from the caller's
data segment, so it is important to understand when this event is called.

## Example Use Case
For example, you can monitor when shared memory is being detached and gather
information such as the process PID and the address of the segment being
detached.

## Issues
Currently, the shmdt() syscall is not able to detach more than one shared memory
segment at a time.
