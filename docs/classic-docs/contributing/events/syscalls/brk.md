# brk

## Intro
brk -  manipulates the calling process's data segment.

## Description
The brk() system call changes the location of the program break, which
defines the end of the process's data segment (i.e., the program break
is the first location after the end of the uninitialized data segment).
Increasing the program break has the effect of allocating memory to the
process; decreasing the break deallocates memory.

The functionality of the brk() system call is provided by libc, which
implements brk() by calling the sbrk() system call. 

## Arguments
* `addr`:`void*`[K] - pointer to the requested address at which the program break would be set.

### Available Tags
* K - Originated from kernel-space.

## Hooks
### sbrk
#### Type
Kprobe+Uprobe
#### Purpose
To hook this function to track when the program break is changed.

## Example Use Case
brk() is used by programs to manage their own memory usage. This is
particularly useful when dealing with dynamic memory allocation.

## Issues
There is no guarantee that brk() will successfully allocate memory.
Additionally, it can lead to memory fragmentation if memory is requested
in large chunks rather than smaller ones.
