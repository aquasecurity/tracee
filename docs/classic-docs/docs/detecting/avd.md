# Signatures in Aqua Vulnerability Database (AVD)

AVD gives detailed information and remediation guidance for
vulnerabilities and weaknesses found in open source applications
and cloud native infrastructure. This includes information about
common techniques and attack vectors that occur at application
runtime.

The AVD entries on runtime security are generated from the
[detection signatures](https://github.com/aquasecurity/tracee/tree/main/signatures) 
in Tracee's detection engine, tracee-rules. This includes signatures for 
credential access, defense evasion, persistence, and privilege escalation.

You can see them at [avd.aquasec.com/tracee](https://avd.aquasec.com/tracee/).
