# Tracee Outputs

Depending on the system, Tracee might collect thousands of logs per day. To improve access and filtering of those logs, it is possible to modify the way logs are displayed and stored. This is done through the `output` and `log` section of the Tracee configuration file. 

For examples on each configuration, please refer to:
* Documentation on configuring [Tracee logs](./logging.md)
* Documentation on configuring [output options](./output-options.md)
* Documentation on configuring [output formats](./output-formats.md)
* Documentation on configuring [output streams](./streams.md)

Example configuration files can be found in the Tracee repository at [examples/config/global_config.yaml](https://github.com/aquasecurity/tracee/blob/main/examples/config/global_config.yaml)
