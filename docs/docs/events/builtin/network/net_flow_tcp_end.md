# NetFlowTCPEnd

## Intro

NetFlowTCPEnd - An event derived from base network raw event, designed to
monitor the termination of TCP flows. It leverages cgroup skb eBPF programs,
focusing specifically on the TCP protocol's termination phase, and is
instrumental in analyzing IP and TCP headers data to detect the end of TCP
connections.

## Description

`NetFlowTCPEnd` utilizes cgroup skb eBPF programs to intercept and analyze raw
network events at the kernel level, with a particular emphasis on the TCP
protocol's termination phase. It processes IP and TCP headers to pinpoint the
conclusion of TCP communication flows. The event identifies the termination of
TCP connections by analyzing the status of TCP flags, primarily focusing on the
FIN and RST flags.

By examining these flags, `NetFlowTCPEnd` provides valuable insights into the
end of TCP connections, a critical component for comprehensive network
monitoring and security analysis.

## Arguments

1. **connectionDirection** (`string`): Indicates whether the terminated connection was 'incoming' or 'outgoing'.
2. **srcIP** (`string`): The source IP address, extracted from the IP header, from the side terminating the connection.
3. **dstIP** (`string`): The destination IP address, obtained from the IP header, of the side receiving the termination.
4. **srcPort** (`uint16`): The source port number, derived from the TCP header.
5. **dstPort** (`uint16`): The destination port number, ascertained from the TCP header.
6. **srcDomains** (`[]string`): Associated domain names for the source IP, resolved using DNS cache.
7. **dstDomains** (`[]string`): Related domain names for the destination IP, determined through DNS cache.

## Origin

### Derived from cgroup skb eBPF Programs

#### Source

`NetFlowTCPEnd` originates from cgroup skb eBPF programs, enabling the tracing
of raw network packets at the kernel level. This advanced mechanism is adept at
dissecting TCP traffic, particularly focusing on the termination stage of TCP
connections.

#### Purpose

The primary aim of `NetFlowTCPEnd` is to provide detailed visibility into the
termination of TCP connections. By concentrating on FIN and RST flags within TCP
headers, it offers an effective and precise approach to identifying the
conclusion of TCP communication flows, crucial for network security and
performance monitoring.

## Example Use Case

Network administrators and security experts can use `NetFlowTCPEnd` to monitor
the termination of TCP connections. This capability is essential for detecting
unusual traffic patterns, potential security threats, or abrupt end of
communication, which are vital for ensuring network security and efficiency.

## Issues

While `NetFlowTCPEnd` is designed to minimize system overhead, its performance
may vary based on the volume of network traffic and the complexity of monitored
TCP flows. Efficient data management and analysis are key to leveraging the full
potential of this event without affecting system performance adversely.
