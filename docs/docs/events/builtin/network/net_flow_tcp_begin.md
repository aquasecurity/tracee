# NetFlowTCPBegin

## Intro

NetFlowTCPBegin - An event derived from a base network raw event, originated
from cgroup skb eBPF programs, specifically designed to monitor the initiation
of TCP flows by analyzing IP and TCP headers data.

## Description

`NetFlowTCPBegin` leverages cgroup skb eBPF programs to capture raw network
events at the kernel level, focusing on the TCP protocol's initiation phase.

This event parses IP and TCP headers, identifying the start of TCP
communication flows based on SYN, ACK, and FIN flag statuses. By concentrating
on these flags, `NetFlowTCPBegin` efficiently discerns the commencement of TCP
connections, providing critical data for network monitoring and security
analysis.

## Arguments

1. **connectionDirection** (`string`): Classifies the connection as 'incoming' or 'outgoing', based on the packet's direction and SYN flag status.
2. **srcIP** (`string`): The source IP address extracted directly from the IP header.
3. **dstIP** (`string`): The destination IP address, ascertained from the IP header.
4. **srcPort** (`uint16`): The source port, derived from the TCP header.
5. **dstPort** (`uint16`): The destination port, obtained from the TCP header.
6. **srcDomains** (`[]string`): Domain names related to the source IP, resolved through DNS cache.
7. **dstDomains** (`[]string`): Domain names associated with the destination IP, also resolved via DNS cache.

## Origin

### Derived from cgroup skb eBPF Programs

#### Source

The `NetFlowTCPBegin` event originates from cgroup skb eBPF programs, which
capture and process raw network packets at the kernel level. This sophisticated
capture mechanism is specifically tailored for dissecting and analyzing TCP
traffic, particularly at the initiation stage of TCP connections.

#### Purpose

The event's primary goal is to provide in-depth visibility into the initiation
of TCP connections. By focusing on SYN/ACK/FIN flags within TCP headers,
`NetFlowTCPBegin` offers an efficient and accurate method for identifying the
start of TCP communication flows, crucial for network security and performance
analysis.

## Example Use Case

Network administrators and security professionals can utilize `NetFlowTCPBegin`
to track the initiation of TCP connections, aiding in the early detection of
unusual traffic patterns or unauthorized communication attempts. This
information is vital for maintaining network integrity and preempting potential
security breaches.

## Issues

Although `NetFlowTCPBegin` is optimized for low overhead, its efficiency
depends on the network traffic volume and the complexity of the TCP flows being
monitored. Proper management and analysis of the generated data are essential
to maximize the benefits of this event without impacting system performance.
