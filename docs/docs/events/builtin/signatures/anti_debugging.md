# Anti-Debugging Technique Detection

## Intro

The `antiDebugging` signature is designed to detect processes that employ
anti-debugging techniques to thwart or block the efforts of debuggers. This
tactic can be a significant indicator of software or malware attempting to
conceal its operations, avoid analysis, or thwart reverse engineering efforts.

## Description

Debugging is a standard and indispensable technique for developers and security
researchers alike. It allows for the examination of software in operation,
making it possible to identify issues, vulnerabilities, or understand the
software's behavior. Some malicious software or even certain commercial
applications incorporate anti-debugging mechanisms to deter analysis.

The `antiDebugging` signature closely monitors for the usage of the `ptrace`
system call with the `PTRACE_TRACEME` request. The `ptrace` system call allows a
process to control another, enabling debugging. When a process invokes `ptrace`
with `PTRACE_TRACEME`, it's essentially asking to be traced by its parent, which
can be a technique to determine if it's currently being debugged.

## Purpose

The primary goal of this signature is to identify and raise alerts about
processes that utilize the `PTRACE_TRACEME` request with `ptrace`. Detection of
such activity can signify attempts by software or malware to engage in defense
evasion by deploying execution guardrails against debugging.

## Metadata

- **Name**: Anti-Debugging
- **Description**: The signature identifies processes that employ the `PTRACE_TRACEME` request with `ptrace` as an anti-debugging technique. This behavior can indicate a program's attempt to evade analysis or thwart reverse engineering.
- **Tags**: linux, container
- **Properties**:
  - **Severity**: 3 (Moderate to high threat level)
  - **MITRE ATT&CK**: Defense Evasion: Execution Guardrails

## Findings

Upon detection of an anti-debugging effort, the signature returns a `Finding`
data structure, which encompasses:

- **SigMetadata**: Metadata that offers comprehensive details about the threat according to the signature's specifications.
- **Event**: A detailed account of the specific event that triggered the signature's alert system.
- **Data**: Contains the specific `ptrace` request used, which, in this context, would be "PTRACE_TRACEME".

## Events Used

The signature's operations hinge primarily on the following event:

- `ptrace`: Activated when the `ptrace` system call is used. The signature
specifically examines the request type to determine if there's an invocation of
`PTRACE_TRACEME`, indicating an anti-debugging attempt.
