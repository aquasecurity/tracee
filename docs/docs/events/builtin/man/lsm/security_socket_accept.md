## NAME

**security_socket_accept** - security check for socket accept operations

## DESCRIPTION

Triggered when a socket attempts to accept an incoming connection. This LSM (Linux Security Module) hook event captures the security check performed before a connection is accepted, providing visibility into network connection establishment.

The event provides information about the accepting socket and the local address details of the accepted connection. This visibility is crucial for security monitoring and network behavior analysis, as it helps identify potential threats or irregular connection patterns.

This event is useful for:

- **Connection monitoring**: Track incoming connection acceptances
- **Security auditing**: Monitor network service activity
- **Access control**: Verify connection acceptance permissions
- **Service analysis**: Understand network service behavior

## EVENT SETS

**none**

## DATA FIELDS

**sockfd** (*int32*)
: The file descriptor of the socket accepting the connection

**local_addr** (*trace.SockAddr*)
: Structure containing the local address details of the accepted connection

## DEPENDENCIES

**LSM Hook:**

- security_socket_accept (required): LSM hook for socket accept security checks

## USE CASES

- **Security monitoring**: Track incoming connection patterns

- **Service auditing**: Monitor network service activity

- **Access control**: Verify connection acceptance permissions

- **Network diagnostics**: Troubleshoot connection issues

- **Behavior analysis**: Understand service connection patterns

## CONNECTION STATES

Important connection acceptance states:

- **Pre-acceptance**: Initial security check phase
- **Acceptance**: Connection establishment
- **Post-acceptance**: New socket creation
- **Error states**: Failed acceptance scenarios

## SECURITY IMPLICATIONS

Critical security aspects to monitor:

- **Unauthorized access**: Unexpected connection attempts
- **Service abuse**: Connection flooding or DoS attempts
- **Protocol violations**: Invalid connection patterns
- **Resource exhaustion**: Connection queue flooding
- **Access control bypass**: Unauthorized service access

## PERFORMANCE CONSIDERATIONS

Connection acceptance impact:

- **Backlog management**: Connection queue handling
- **Resource allocation**: Socket descriptor usage
- **Processing overhead**: Security check costs
- **Queue limits**: Maximum pending connections
