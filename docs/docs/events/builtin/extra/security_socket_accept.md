# security_socket_accept

## Intro

security_socket_accept - An event capturing details when a socket accepts an
incoming connection.

## Description

This event is triggered whenever a socket accepts a connection request. The eBPF
program hooks into the kernel's `security_socket_accept` function, extracting
details about the socket involved and the accepted connection's local address.

Monitoring the acceptance of incoming connections can provide insights into the
activity of servers and applications, shedding light on potential threats or
irregular behaviors.

## Arguments

1. **sockfd** (`int`): The file descriptor referring to the socket accepting the connection.
2. **local_addr** (`struct sockaddr*`): A pointer to the structure holding the local address details of the accepted connection.

## Hooks

### trace_security_socket_accept

#### Type

Kprobe (using `kprobe/security_socket_accept`).

#### Purpose

To observe and gather data whenever a socket accepts an incoming connection. The
captured data gets saved into a buffer, which is subsequently submitted to
user-space for further analysis or logging.

## Example Use Case

A server application could utilize this event to maintain a log of all incoming
connections, ensuring awareness of all entities connecting to the server. This
can be crucial for security, especially in scenarios where unauthorized access
might occur. Diagnostics tools might also employ this event to troubleshoot
network connectivity issues.
