## Intro

**container_remove** - A derived event that signifies the termination of an existing container.

## Description

The `container_remove` event indicates when a container is terminated, making it
easier to track container activities.

Each container's life cycle is tied to its respective directory within the
`cgroupfs`. By harnessing the data from the `cgroup_rmdir` event and delving
into the associated metadata within the `cgroupfs` subdirectories, the
`container_remove` event determines if a directory's removal correlates with a
container's termination.

Consequently, it captures vital information about the terminated container, such
as its runtime and unique identifier. This aids administrators and operators in
comprehending container lifecycle dynamics and ensuring system reliability.

## Arguments

- **runtime** (`const char*`): The runtime employed by the container, such as Docker, containerd, etc.
- **container_id** (`const char*`): The distinct identifier allocated to the container.

## Derivation Logic

The genesis of the `container_remove` event is from the `cgroup_rmdir` event.
Initially, it assesses whether the cgroup event pertains to the root directory
of a terminating container. Subsequently, utilizing the `cgroup_id` -
originating from the cgroup directory inode - it garners container-centric
information, a capability augmented by tracee interactions with runtime daemons.

## Example Use Case

1. Security Monitoring: Scrutinizing container terminations to identify potential security breaches or anomalous activities.
2. Resource Management: Monitoring container terminations to manage and reclaim system resources efficiently.
3. System Reliability: Keeping track of container terminations to ensure stable and expected operations within the infrastructure.

## Related Events

- cgroup_rmdir: The foundational event from which `container_remove` is derived.
It offers insights into the removal of cgroup directories.
