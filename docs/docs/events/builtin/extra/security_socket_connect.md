# security_socket_connect

## Intro

security_socket_connect - An event that captures details when a socket attempts
to make a connection.

## Description

This event is triggered when a socket tries to establish a connection. The eBPF
program is attached to the kernel's `security_socket_connect` function and
captures information about the socket, as well as the remote address it's trying
to connect to.

Given the importance of network communications for many applications, monitoring
socket connections can be crucial for security, diagnostics, and compliance
reasons.

## Arguments

1. **sockfd** (`int`): The file descriptor referring to the socket attempting the connection.
2. **remote_addr** (`struct sockaddr*`): A pointer to the structure that holds the remote address details. Depending on the address family (IPv4, IPv6, or UNIX), it can point to different specific structures (`struct sockaddr_in`, `struct sockaddr_in6`, or `struct sockaddr_un`).

## Hooks

### trace_security_socket_connect

#### Type

Kprobe (using `kprobe/security_socket_connect`).

#### Purpose

To monitor and extract data whenever a socket tries to connect. Depending on the
address family of the socket, different pieces of data are saved to a buffer,
which are then submitted to user-space for further processing or logging.

## Example Use Case

A security application might leverage this event to track all outbound
connections from a system. This can be vital for identifying potentially
malicious communications or connections to unknown endpoints. Additionally,
diagnostics tools can utilize this information to debug network-related issues
in applications.

## Issues

Monitoring every socket connection might introduce overhead, especially in
systems with frequent network communications. It's essential to balance the need
for monitoring with potential performance implications.
