# cgroup_rmdir

## Intro

**cgroup_rmdir** - An event that is triggered whenever a cgroup directory is removed.

## Description

The `cgroup_rmdir` event is intricately crafted to monitor the removal of
directories within the cgroup filesystem. As containers are orchestrated and
managed using control groups (`cgroup`), the removal of a directory often
indicates the termination or scaling down of a container instance.

By keeping tabs on these directory removal events with `cgroup_rmdir`, operators
can capture crucial insights into container terminations, resource
deallocations, and other significant container lifecycle events within the
system.

This event is pivotal for administrators looking to scrutinize container
lifecycle events and for understanding the orchestration dynamics in complex
containerized environments.

## Arguments

- **cgroup_id** (`u64`): The unique identifier associated with the cgroup being removed.
- **cgroup_path** (`const char*`): The file system path pointing to the cgroup directory that's being removed.
- **hierarchy_id** (`u32`): Denotes the hierarchy level of the cgroup that's being removed.

## Hooks

### tracepoint__cgroup__cgroup_rmdir

#### Type

Raw tracepoint (utilizing `raw_tracepoint/cgroup_rmdir`).

#### Purpose

To keenly observe and capture details each time a `cgroup` directory is removed.
Information related to the cgroup's unique identifier, its file system path, and
its hierarchy level is collected.

## Example Use Case

1. Container Termination Monitoring**: By tracing cgroup directory removals, the
system can identify when containers are terminated, offering a perspective into
system scaling dynamics and potential anomalies.
2. Resource Cleanup: Keeping track of the removal of cgroups helps in
understanding resource deallocations and ensuring efficient resource usage
across the infrastructure.
