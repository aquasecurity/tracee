# security_socket_bind

## Intro

security_socket_bind - An event capturing details when a socket is bound to an
address and port.

## Description

This event gets triggered whenever a socket is bound to a local address and
port, a crucial step for setting up servers or defining source addresses for
outgoing connections.i

The eBPF program hooks into the kernel's `security_socket_bind` function,
capturing details about the socket involved and the address to which it binds.

Monitoring socket bindings can provide insights into the activities of servers,
services, and applications, revealing which services are being started or if
specific services are being bound to unexpected addresses.

## Arguments

1. **sockfd** (`int`): The file descriptor referring to the socket that is being bound.
2. **local_addr** (`struct sockaddr*`): A pointer to the structure holding the local address and port details to which the socket is binding.

## Hooks

### trace_security_socket_bind

#### Type

Kprobe (using `kprobe/security_socket_bind`).

#### Purpose

To observe and gather data whenever a socket is bound to a local address and
port. The captured data, including the socket's descriptor and its binding
address, gets saved into a buffer and is subsequently submitted to user-space
for further processing, analysis, or logging.

## Example Use Case

Monitoring the `security_socket_bind` event can be of high value for server or
network administrators. By observing this event, they can get insights about the
services being initiated, ensuring that only authorized services are started and
unexpected bindings are detected, which can be a sign of misconfiguration or a
potential threat.
