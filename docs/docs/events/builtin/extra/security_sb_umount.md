# security_sb_umount

## Intro

security_sb_umount - An event capturing the details when a file system is unmounted.

## Description

The event gets triggered whenever a file system is unmounted in the system, which
could be a significant action from both a system administration and security
perspective.

By hooking into the kernel's `security_sb_umount` function, this eBPF program
captures details such as the device name, the path that is being umounted, the type of the file system,
and the flags provided for the umount operation.

Monitoring such umount events can provide a deep understanding of system
operations and potential anomalies.

## Arguments

1. **dev_name** (`const char*`): The name of the device being mounted.
2. **path** (`const char*`): The destination path in the file system where the device will be mounted.
3. **type** (`const char*`): The type of the file system being mounted (e.g., `ext4`, `nfs`, etc.).
4. **flags** (`unsigned long`): The flags that specify the mount options. 

## Hooks

### trace_security_sb_umount

#### Type

Kprobe (using `kprobe/security_sb_umount`).

#### Purpose

To observe and gather data whenever a file system is unmounted. The captured
details include the device name, mounting path, file system type, and flags. All
this information is saved into a buffer and is then submitted to user-space for
further analysis or logging.

## Example Use Case

By tracking the `security_sb_umount` event, system administrators can gain
insights about what devices or file systems are being unmounted, ensuring that
only authorized actions are taken and detecting unexpected umounts, which could
be a potential sign of malicious activity or system misconfiguration.

## Related Events

To get a more comprehensive view of system operations related to storage, it's
beneficial to monitor this event in conjunction with others, like file system
mounting or device initialization events.
