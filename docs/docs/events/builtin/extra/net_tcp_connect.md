# NetTCPConnect

## Intro

NetTCPConnect - An event that monitors the `connect()` system call, providing
detailed information about destination addresses including DNS resolutions.

## Description

`NetTCPConnect` is a high-level event derived from the underlying
`security_socket_connect` LSM (Linux Security Module) hook. This event is
triggered whenever the `connect()` system call is invoked in the system,
capturing attempts by sockets to establish a connection.

Unlike direct kernel probes, this LSM-based approach is not susceptible to
Time-Of-Check to Time-Of-Use (TOCTOU) race conditions, making it a reliable
source for monitoring socket connections.

## Arguments

1. **dstIP** (`string`): The destination IP address to which the socket is attempting to connect.  2. **dstPort** (`int`): The port number at the destination.
3. **results** (`[]string`): DNS resolutions made to the destination IP, providing contextual information about the connection attempt.

## Origin

### Derived from `security_socket_connect`

#### Source

This event is derived from the `security_socket_connect` LSM hook. The LSM
framework provides a way to track and control various aspects of system
behavior, and `security_socket_connect` specifically monitors socket connection
attempts.

#### Purpose

The purpose of deriving `NetTCPConnect` from `security_socket_connect` is to
provide a more user-friendly and context-enriched view of socket connection
attempts. This includes not only the basic connection details but also DNS
resolution information, offering a comprehensive overview of network activities
for security monitoring.

## Example Use Case

`NetTCPConnect` can be used by security applications to monitor and log all
outbound connection attempts in a system. It is particularly useful for
detecting unusual network patterns or connections to suspicious endpoints,
playing a crucial role in intrusion detection and network behavior analysis.

## Issues

While `NetTCPConnect` offers detailed information about connection attempts,
it's important to consider the volume of data generated, especially in systems
with high network activity. Efficient data handling and analysis are key to
leveraging the full potential of this event without overwhelming system
resources or analysts.
