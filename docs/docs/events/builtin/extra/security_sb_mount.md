# security_sb_mount

## Intro

security_sb_mount - An event capturing the details when a file system is mounted.

## Description

The event gets triggered whenever a file system is mounted in the system, which
could be a significant action from both a system administration and security
perspective.

By hooking into the kernel's `security_sb_mount` function, this eBPF program
captures details such as the device name, the path where the filesystem will be
mounted, the type of the file system, and the flags provided for the mount
operation.

Monitoring such mount events can provide a deep understanding of system
operations and potential anomalies. For example, if an unexpected device or file
system gets mounted, it could be indicative of a security breach or system
misconfiguration.

## Arguments

1. **dev_name** (`const char*`): The name of the device being mounted.
2. **path** (`const char*`): The destination path in the file system where the device will be mounted.
3. **type** (`const char*`): The type of the file system being mounted (e.g., `ext4`, `nfs`, etc.).
4. **flags** (`unsigned long`): The flags that specify the mount options. 

## Hooks

### trace_security_sb_mount

#### Type

Kprobe (using `kprobe/security_sb_mount`).

#### Purpose

To observe and gather data whenever a file system is mounted. The captured
details include the device name, mounting path, file system type, and flags. All
this information is saved into a buffer and is then submitted to user-space for
further analysis or logging.

## Example Use Case

By tracking the `security_sb_mount` event, system administrators can gain
insights about what devices or file systems are being mounted, ensuring that
only authorized actions are taken and detecting unexpected mounts, which could
be a potential sign of malicious activity or system misconfiguration.

## Related Events

To get a more comprehensive view of system operations related to storage, it's
beneficial to monitor this event in conjunction with others, like file system
unmounting or device initialization events.
