# getegid16

## Intro
getegid16 - get real group ID for the calling process

## Description
getegid16 returns the real group ID of the calling process, as seen by the kernel. This call is functionally identical to getegid except that it takes a 16-bit argument, and returns 16-bit. 

The underlying system call returnes a 32-bit value, which is truncated and returned as a 16-bit integer. This call is mainly present on older systems, but new programs should rather use the getegid call if possible.

## Arguments
This syscall does not take any arguments.

### Available Tags

## Hooks
The `sys_getegid16` function can be hooked.

### sys_getegid16
#### Type
Kprobes
#### Purpose
Kprobes provide the highest level of kernel instrumentation and can measure time at any byte-code level in any part of the kernel. By hooking into this function, it is possible to measure the kernel execution time for system calls.

## Example Use Case
For example, this call can be used for measuring the latency of the system call in an embedded system or a system under high load.
