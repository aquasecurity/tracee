## Intro
unlinkat - system call that deletes a file name, relative to an open directory

## Description
unlinkat is a system call that deletes a file name, relative to an open directory. The purpose of unlinkat is to provide a more secure and robust way to delete a file than the remove() syscall, as it allows users to avoid race conditions while deleting a file. 

Unlinkat also allows a user to delete links without traversing whole directory hierarchies, by providing the location of the file (directory) and its name as two separate arguments.

Unlinkat also provides the option to not traverse symbolic links with the **O_NOFOLLOW** flag. This allows users to delete symbolic links more securely.

## Arguments
* `dirfd`:`int`[K] - an open file descriptor referring to a directory.
* `pathname`:`const char*`[KU] - a string containing the name of the file to be deleted, relative to the directory referred to by dirfd.
* `flags`:`int`[K] - optional flags that can include **O_NOFOLLOW**, **AT_REMOVEDIR**, or **AT_SYMLINK_NOFOLLOW**.

### Available Tags
* K - Originated from kernel-space.
* U - Originated from user space (for example, pointer to user space memory used to get it)
* TOCTOU - Vulnerable to TOCTOU (time of check, time of use)
* OPT - Optional argument - might not always be available (passed with null value)

## Hooks
### sys_unlinkat
#### Type
Tracepoint
#### Purpose
To monitor file deletions.

## Example Use Case
Finding malicious file deletions.

## Issues
unlinkat is vulnerable to TOCTOU (time of check, time of use) attacks if the **O_NOFOLLOW** flag is not included.
