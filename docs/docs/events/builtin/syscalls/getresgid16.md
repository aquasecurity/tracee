# getresgid16

## Intro
getresgid16 - get the real, effective, and saved group IDs of the calling process

## Description
The getresgid16() system call gets the real, effective, and saved group IDs of the calling process (in that order).

Using this call, a process can be sure that its real, effective and saved group IDs are the same.  This can help with privilege elevation when changing credentials.

Since it takes no arguments, there are no edge-cases or drawbacks, however, in kernel versions prior to 4.20 the `allocated` argument was present and had to be set to the size of the `old_gid_t` type, which might be confusing for some.

## Arguments
* `rgid`:`old_gid_t*`[K] - Pointer to the real group ID of the caller.
* `egid`:`old_gid_t*`[K] - Pointer to the effective group ID of the caller.
* `sgid`:`old_gid_t*`[K] - Pointer to the saved group ID of the caller.

### Available Tags
* K - Originated from kernel-space.

## Hooks
### do_getresgid16
#### Type
Kprobe
#### Purpose
To allow users to trace or monitor calls to the getresgid16() system call from user space.

## Example Use Case
Monitoring the progress of setting the caller's real, effective, and saved group IDs.

## Issues
In some kernels, the `allocated` argument had to be set to the size of the `old_gid_t` type, but this was deprecated in kernel 4.20.
