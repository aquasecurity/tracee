## Intro
nanosleep - Suspend execution of the calling thread for whatever is specified by req.

## Description
nanosleep is used to suspend execution of the calling thread until either the time interval specified in the structure pointed to by req has passed or the delivery of a signal which triggers the invocation of a signal-catching function. This structure value remains in effect until nanosleep finishes, it will not currently adjust the timer in case of interrupted by a signal handler. There are some edge cases and inadequacies related to the timing of nanosleep and how it is affected by clock changes, system load and other processes.

## Arguments
* `req`:`const struct timespec*`[K] - Pointer to a structure that specifies an interval of time, of type struct timespec, to pause execution of the calling thread.
* `rem`:`struct timespec*`[KU] - Pointer to a structure that shall receive the time still remaining of the interval specified in req, of type struct timespec.

### Available Tags
* K - Originated from kernel-space.
* U - Originated from user space (for example, pointer to user space memory used to get it)
* TOCTOU - Vulnerable to TOCTOU (time of check, time of use)
* OPT - Optional argument - might not always be available (passed with null value)

## Hooks
### do_sys_nanosleep
#### Type
kprobe
#### Purpose
To find the overhead of nanosleep invocations.

## Example Use Case
nanosleep can be used to sleep for a specified length of time to produce a slowdown for the process that is being profiled. It can also be used to yield the CPU running time to other threads and processes.

## Issues
Since nanosleep is based on the systemâ€™s kernel jiffies counter, its accuracy can be affected by system load, other processes and clock changes. This may cause nanosleep to return earlier or later than requested.

syscall_entry (for nanosleep) - Event that is triggered when a syscall is entered.  
syscall_exit (for nanosleep) - Event that is triggered when a syscall is exited.
