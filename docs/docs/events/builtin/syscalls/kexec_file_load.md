# kexec_file_load

## Intro
kexec_file_load - Parse a kexec file and load it into memory.

## Description
This system call enables the ability to load a kernel image from a file descriptor into the kernel for later execution. It can be used to make changes to the kernel faster, such as with version upgrades or hardware-related updates. This executes from kernel space, so the file descriptors are coming from kernel space.

It also has a few drawbacks, such as:
* It can be hard to verify that the kernel image is correct and free from malicious code. 
* It may be slow to execute, depending on the hardware and how large the kernel image is.

## Arguments
* `kernel_fd`:`int`[K] - File descriptor containing the kernel image.
* `initrd_fd`:`int`[K] - File descriptor containing the kernel initrd.
* `cmdline_len`:`unsigned long`[K] - Length of the kernel command line, in bytes.
* `cmdline`:`const char*`[K] - Pointer to kernel command line, in kernel mode memory.
* `flags`:`unsigned long`[K] - Optional flags to modify the behavior of the system call.

### Available Tags
* K - Originated from kernel-space.

## Hooks
### do_modify_ldt
#### Type
kprobes
#### Purpose
To ensure that the system call does not modify user-space address tables. 

## Example Use Case
For example, kexec_file_load can be used to quickly switch from one kernel version to another in order to update the system or to reap the benefits of a newer kernel version.

## Issues
It can be susceptible to a Time-of-Check Time-of-Use (TOCTOU) vulnerability if not properly guarded against.

## Related Events
* kexec_load: Allows loading of a kernel image without parsing it first.
* kexec_file_unload: Unloads a previously loaded kexec file.
