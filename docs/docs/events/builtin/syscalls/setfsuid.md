# setfsuid

## Intro

setfsuid - set the filesystem user ID.

## Description

The `setfsuid()` system call permits a process to change its filesystem user ID,
which is utilized primarily for determining file access permissions during the
execution of a system call. The filesystem UID is typically equal to the
effective UID of a process, but they can differ in certain contexts.

The primary intent of `setfsuid()` is to allow a process to temporarily alter
its identity when accessing filesystem resources without changing the effective
UID. It offers a more granular level of access control to the filesystem,
especially useful for programs that manage files on behalf of other users.

## Arguments

* `fsuid`:`uid_t`[K] - The new filesystem user ID to be set.

### Available Tags

* K - Originated from kernel-space.
* U - Originated from user space.
* TOCTOU - Vulnerable to TOCTOU (time of check, time of use).
* OPT - Optional argument - might not always be available (passed with null value).

## Hooks

### sys_setfsuid

#### Type

Tracepoint (through `sys_enter`).

#### Purpose

To observe and trace occurrences of the `setfsuid()` system call, capturing
details about the new filesystem user ID being set.

## Example Use Case

Tracking changes in filesystem UIDs provides a way to monitor and audit file
access behaviors, ensuring that processes aren't manipulating file permissions
inappropriately or accessing files they shouldn't.

## Issues

If not used with caution, `setfsuid()` can lead to incorrect file access
permissions, possibly giving processes more permissions than intended or
bypassing certain security mechanisms.

## Related Events

* `setfsgid()` - Set the filesystem group ID.
* `setuid()` - Set the effective user ID.
* `seteuid()` - Set effective user ID.
