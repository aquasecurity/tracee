# setgid

## Intro

setgid - set the effective group ID of the calling process.

## Description

The `setgid()` system call enables a process to change its effective group ID.

This is an essential mechanism in Unix-like operating systems, allowing
processes to acquire or drop group-based permissions. Just as with `setuid()`,
programs that run with set-group-ID-on-exec (the setgid bit) will operate with
the file's group ID as its effective group ID.

`setgid()` is often used in conjunction with `setuid()` in programs that need to
temporarily escalate or change privileges to perform specific tasks. By using
`setgid()`, programs can ensure they operate with the least amount of
group-based privilege necessary, enhancing system security.

## Arguments

* `gid`:`gid_t`[K] - The group ID which will be set as the effective group ID of the calling process.

### Available Tags

* K - Originated from kernel-space.
* U - Originated from user space.
* TOCTOU - Vulnerable to TOCTOU (time of check, time of use).
* OPT - Optional argument - might not always be available (passed with null value).

## Hooks

### sys_setgid

#### Type

Tracepoint (through `sys_enter`).

#### Purpose

To observe and trace when the `setgid()` system call is performed, capturing details about the group ID being set.

## Example Use Case

Monitoring changes in group privileges in a system, particularly in scenarios
where group-based access control is crucial for security or resource sharing.

## Issues

Similar to `setuid()`, if `setgid()` is misused or if programs leveraging it
contain vulnerabilities, it can pave the way for privilege escalation attacks.
Care must be taken to ensure that programs drop group-based privileges
appropriately and securely.

## Related Events

* `setuid()` - Set the effective user ID of the calling process.
* `setegid()` - Set the effective group ID, but retain the original real group ID.
* `setregid()` - Set real and/or effective group ID.
