# truncate64

## Intro
truncate64() - truncate a file to a specified length

## Description
The truncate64() system call is used to truncate a file to a specified length.  If the file is larger than the length specified, the extra data is lost. If the file is shorter than the length specified, the file will be extended with NUL bytes (`\0`). The truncate64() system call operates on files, not directories.

## Arguments
* `path`:`const char*` - pathname of the file whose length is to be changed
* `length`:`off_t` - size to which the file should be truncated

## Example Use Case
truncate64() can be used to ensure that a certain file does not exceed a certain size. For example, it can be used to ensure a log file does not exceed 1GB in size.

## Issues
The truncate64() system call does not check if the current user has the necessary permissions to truncate the file, this must be done manually.
