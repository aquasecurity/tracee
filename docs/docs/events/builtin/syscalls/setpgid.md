# setpgid

## Intro
setpgid - Set the process group ID of a process

## Description
The setpgid() function sets the process group ID of the process specified by pid to pgid.  If pid is zero, the process ID of the current process is used.  If pgid is zero, the process ID of the process specified by pid is used.  The setpgid() system call is allowed only for a process with a single thread.

Setpgid can be used to implement job control in a shell.  In a single-threaded program, setpgid() can be used to create a new process group within the same session.

## Arguments
* `pid`:`pid_t` - The process ID of the process.
* `pgid`:`pid_t` - The ID of the process group to which the process should be moved.

### Available Tags
* K - Originated from kernel-space.

## Hooks

#### Type
Kprobe
#### Purpose
To instrument the process control system call to detect changes in the process group ID.

## Example Use Case
Monitoring changes in process group IDs, particularly when using Job Control (e.g. with a shell).

## Issues
None.
