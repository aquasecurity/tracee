# setpgid

## Intro

setpgid - set the process group ID for a process.

## Description

The `setpgid()` system call is used to set the process group ID of a specific
process.

This is particularly useful for creating or changing sessions, job control, and
other process grouping related tasks in Unix-like operating systems. When a new
process is created, it inherits the process group ID of its parent. Using
`setpgid()`, processes can be re-assigned to different groups, facilitating
group-based operations like signaling.

## Arguments

* `pid`:`pid_t`[K] - Process ID of the target process. If `pid` is zero, the process ID of the calling process is used.
* `pgid`:`pid_t`[K] - The process group ID to be set. If `pgid` is zero, the process ID of the process specified by `pid` is used.

### Available Tags

* K - Originated from kernel-space.
* U - Originated from user space.
* TOCTOU - Vulnerable to TOCTOU (time of check, time of use).
* OPT - Optional argument - might not always be available (passed with null value).

## Hooks

### sys_setpgid

#### Type

Tracepoint (through `sys_enter`).

#### Purpose

To observe and trace the invocation of the `setpgid()` system call, capturing
information about the process and the new process group ID.

## Example Use Case

Monitoring process group changes, especially in scenarios where job control or
session management is vital, such as in shell environments or process managers.

## Issues

Improper usage of `setpgid()` can lead to processes being unintentionally grouped together, potentially causing unintended signaling or termination of processes.

## Related Events

* `getpgid()` - Retrieve the process group ID of a process.
* `setsid()` - Create a new session and set the process group ID.
* `getpgrp()` - Get the process group ID of the calling process.
