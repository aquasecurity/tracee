# process_vm_readv

## Intro

process_vm_readv - transfer data between the address spaces of two processes.

## Description

The `process_vm_readv()` system call is designed to perform a vectorized read
from a specified process's address space, transferring data to another process's
address space without the need for intermediate buffers or filesystem-based
methods. This is primarily utilized for cross-process memory access, such as
debugging tools or some specialized inter-process communication techniques.

## Arguments

* `pid`:`pid_t`[K] - Process ID of the target process from which data is to be read.
* `local_iov`:`struct iovec *`[U] - Pointer to an array of `iovec` structures that determine the local memory segments.
* `liovcnt`:`unsigned long`[K] - Number of elements in `local_iov`.
* `remote_iov`:`struct iovec *`[U] - Pointer to an array of `iovec` structures that determine the remote memory segments in the target process.
* `riovcnt`:`unsigned long`[K] - Number of elements in `remote_iov`.
* `flags`:`unsigned long`[K] - Flag bits to modify operation (usually set to 0).

### Available Tags

* K - Originated from kernel-space.
* U - Originated from user space.
* TOCTOU - Vulnerable to TOCTOU (time of check, time of use).
* OPT - Optional argument - might not always be available (passed with null value).

## Hooks

### sys_process_vm_readv

#### Type

Tracepoint (through `sys_enter`).

#### Purpose

To monitor and trace when the `process_vm_readv()` system call is executed,
capturing details about the source and target memory regions and the processes
involved.

## Example Use Case

Building a debugging or monitoring tool that requires direct reading of memory
from a target process without inducing significant overhead or relying on
file-based methods.

## Issues

`process_vm_readv()` could be exploited in specific scenarios where unauthorized
memory access is attempted. Proper permissions and checks should always be in
place to avoid unintended data leaks or security implications.
