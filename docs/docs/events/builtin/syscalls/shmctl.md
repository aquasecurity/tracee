## Intro
shmctl - System V shared memory operations

## Description
The `shmctl` system call is used to control System V (SVIPC) shared memory
segments. It operates on the shared memory segment identified by the given
`shmid` value. The `cmd` argument is used to specify the specific operation
that needs to be performed. The `buf` argument is used to tell the kernel
additional information about the operation, such as the data structure of
`struct shmid_ds` defining the permission and size of the shared memory
segment.

The `shmctl` system call is generally used to control the state of shared
memory segments, like attach, detach, get the size of a segment, change
permissions and so on.

The main advantages of using `shmctl` are that it provides an interface which
is generic, easy to use and allows a range of different operations on shared
memory segments.

## Arguments
* `shmid`:`int`[K] - The id of the shared memory segment as returned by
  `shmget`.
* `cmd`:`int`[K] - The command to be performed on the shared memory segment,
  can range from `IPC_STAT` to `IPC_RMID`.
* `buf`:`struct shmid_ds*`[K] - Pointer to the buffer containing the
  information about the command to be performed on the shared memory segment.

### Available Tags
* K - Originated from kernel-space.
* U - Originated from user space (for example, pointer to user space memory used to get it)
* TOCTOU - Vulnerable to TOCTOU (time of check, time of use)
* OPT - Optional argument - might not always be available (passed with null value)

## Hooks
### `sys_shmctl`
#### Type
Kprobe
#### Purpose
Hooked to get invoked whenever a `shmctl` system call is executed.

## Example Use Case
The `shmctl` system call can be useful for development in data structures,
message passing and process scheduling for distributed computing systems. It
can be used to create shared memory segments, update information about
existing memory segments, remove shared memory segments and more.

## Issues
Since the `shmctl` system call is vulnerable to TOCTOU (time-of-check/time-of-use) attack,
as some of its arguments can change between the time they are checked and used, 
it is very important to be aware of the security implications.
