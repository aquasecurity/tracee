## Intro
fanotify_init - initialize fanotify handle

## Description
The fanotify_init() system call initializes the fanotify handle, which is  used  to  register  fanotify  events  and  mark  paths  and  files  to  be  monitored with the `fanotify_mark` system call. This call allocates the required structures, sets the given flags and allocates an event queue.

A fanotify handle can be used to monitor events in multiple directories by calling the `fanotify_mark` system call and the returned file descriptor can be monitored with `select()`, `poll()` or `epoll_wait()`.

The flags used in fanotify_init determine the behavior of the fanotify handle. Some of the available flags are `FAN_CLOEXEC`, `FAN_NONBLOCK` and `FAN_UNLIMITED_QUEUE`.

## Arguments
* `flags`:`unsigned int`[K] - set of flags used to determine the behavior of the fanotify handle.
* `event_f_flags`:`unsigned int`[K] - set of event flags used to select the events to report to the fanotify handle.
