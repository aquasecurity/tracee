# setsid

## Intro

setsid - create a new session and set the process group ID.

## Description

The `setsid()` system call is instrumental in creating a new session.

A session is a collection of process groups, typically used in terminal job
control. When a process calls `setsid()`, it becomes the leader of a new
session, the leader of a new process group, and detaches from its controlling
terminal.

This mechanism is foundational for daemon processes in Unix-like systems,
allowing them to dissociate from their parent shell and run in the background,
independent of the user's session.

## Arguments

This system call doesn't take any arguments.

### Available Tags

* K - Originated from kernel-space.
* U - Originated from user space.
* TOCTOU - Vulnerable to TOCTOU (time of check, time of use).
* OPT - Optional argument - might not always be available (passed with null value).

## Hooks

### sys_setsid

#### Type

Tracepoint (through `sys_enter`).

#### Purpose

To observe and trace when the `setsid()` system call is invoked, marking the
creation of a new session and process group.

## Example Use Case

Monitoring the creation of new sessions is vital in scenarios where tracking
background processes, daemonizing processes, or job control is essential, such
as in system initialization or process supervision.

## Issues

Misusing `setsid()` can cause processes to become orphaned unintentionally or
detached from their expected sessions, leading to potential mismanagement of
resources or processes running without supervision.

## Related Events

* `setpgid()` - Set the process group ID for a process.
* `getpgid()` - Retrieve the process group ID of a process.
* `getpgrp()` - Get the process group ID of the calling process.
