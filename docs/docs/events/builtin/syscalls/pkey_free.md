# pkey_free

## Intro
pkey_free - frees an arch-specific key assigned to a memory address

## Description
pkey_free is a syscall which removes the architecture-specific protection key
assigned to a memory address. The memory address associated with the protection
key is then available to be accessed without any restrictions, and the
protection key is freed from the table managed by the kernel.

This syscall is necessary when dealing with memory regions where access needs
to be restricted for particular users or tasks. This can be done by assigning
an array of protection keys to a memory address. Access to this memory will
then be restricted to those users and tasks that have been assigned the
protection key.

## Arguments
* `pkey`:`int`[K] - key to be freed.

### Available Tags
* K - Originated from kernel-space.

## Hooks
### pkey_free
#### Type
Kprobes
#### Purpose
To monitor the freeing of protection keys by users or processes, as well as to detect any potential misuse.

## Example Use Case
pkey_free can be used to enforce memory protection policies. For example, it
can be used to restrict access to certain sensitive memory regions to a
select group of users or tasks.

## Issues
No known issues.
