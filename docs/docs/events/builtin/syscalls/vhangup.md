# vhangup

## Intro
vhangup - Revoke access to all descriptors associated with the caller's tty

## Description
The vhangup() system call will cause all descriptors associated with the caller's tty to be revoked. On Mac OS X, and many other Unix-like operating systems, this system call has been made obsolete by the setsid() system call. On some Linux-based systems, using this system call may reset certain signal -> PID mappings and socket connection state.

Using vhangup may also cause some process wait states to be reset. Note that, using this system call may cause certain terminal state to be reset, such as terminal baud rate, size and control characters.
