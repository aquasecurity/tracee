# timer_delete

## Intro
timer_delete - deletes previously created timer

## Description
timer_delete() deletes the specified timer, timer_id. The timer must have been 
created by a previous call to timer_create(2) and must not have been already 
deleted. The associated clock, allocated memory and timer overrun handlers are 
all released. If a required underlying alarm request was issued to the real-time 
clock, it is also canceled. After a successful timer_delete() call, the timer_t 
value is invalid and should not be reused.

## Arguments
* `timer_id`:`timer_t`[K] - ID of the timer to be deleted.

### Available Tags

## Example Use Case
timer_delete can be used to delete a timer, which was created by a previous 
call to timer_create(2), in order to prevent it from expiring.

## Issues
If a call to timer_delete() fails, the timer may be left in an undefined state, 
which can cause the timer to be reused at a future point in time.
