# process_vm_writev

## Intro

process_vm_writev - transfer data between the address spaces of two processes.

## Description

The `process_vm_writev()` system call facilitates a vectorized write to a
specified process's address space from another process's address space, enabling
direct memory-to-memory data transfers. Like its counterpart
`process_vm_readv()`, this syscall provides a mechanism for direct inter-process
memory access, which is particularly beneficial for debugging tools or certain
specialized inter-process communication methods.

## Arguments

* `pid`:`pid_t`[K] - Process ID of the target process to which data is to be written.
* `local_iov`:`struct iovec *`[U] - Pointer to an array of `iovec` structures indicating the local memory segments.
* `liovcnt`:`unsigned long`[K] - Number of elements in `local_iov`.
* `remote_iov`:`struct iovec *`[U] - Pointer to an array of `iovec` structures pointing to the remote memory segments in the target process.
* `riovcnt`:`unsigned long`[K] - Number of elements in `remote_iov`.
* `flags`:`unsigned long`[K] - Flag bits to modify operation (typically set to 0).

### Available Tags

* K - Originated from kernel-space.
* U - Originated from user space.
* TOCTOU - Vulnerable to TOCTOU (time of check, time of use).
* OPT - Optional argument - might not always be available (passed with null value).

## Hooks

### sys_process_vm_writev

#### Type

Tracepoint (through `sys_enter`).

#### Purpose

To monitor and capture instances when the `process_vm_writev()` system call is
invoked, detailing the source and destination memory regions and the processes
involved.

## Example Use Case

Crafting a tool or utility that necessitates direct writing to the memory of a
target process, bypassing file-based methods or other indirect techniques. This
is seen in some advanced debugging or monitoring tools.

## Issues

The use of `process_vm_writev()` can introduce security risks, especially when
not appropriately guarded. Unauthorized memory writes can compromise process
integrity, and as such, proper permissions and checks must always be enforced to
prevent malicious actions.
