# lchown16

## Intro
lchown16 - the lchown16() function changes the ownership and group of the file referenced by pathname to the numeric uid and gid.

## Description

The lchown16() function is a system call used to change the user ID and group ID of the file referenced by pathname. This can only be done by the user who owns the file or by the superuser. It does not affect symbolic links. This system call does not dereference pathname, so the ownership of a symbolic link itself is modified rather than the file referenced.

This system call applies to Linux systems with an old 32-bit user ID space and should not be used on current systems.

## Arguments

* `pathname`:`const char*`[K] - Path of the file to change the owner and group.
* `owner`:`old_uid_t`[K] - Numeric ID of the owner.
* `group`:`old_gid_t`[K] - Numeric ID of the group.

### Available Tags

* K - Originated from kernel-space.

## Hooks

### sys_lchown16

#### Type

#### Purpose
Hook this function to monitor ownership changes of files on the system.

## Example Use Case
This system call can be used by an application to make sure that a file or directory has the expected user and group ownership before it is created.

## Issues
The lchown16() system call should not be used on current systems with the new 64-bit user ID and group ID spaces.
