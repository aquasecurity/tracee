# Exit

## Intro 
exit -- Cause normal process termination

## Description
The `exit()` syscall is used to terminate the process that called it. All the 
resources held by the process, such as open files and memory mappings, are released 
as part of the process termination. The status code is passed to other processes 
to inform them about the termination of the process.

## Arguments
* `status`:`int` - The status code of process which is returned to the parent 
process. The lower 8 bits of the status code contains the exiting status (please 
check the manual for more details). The higher 8 bit bits of the status code 
contain certain flags.

### Available Tags
* K - Originated from kernel-space.
* TOCTOU - vulnerable to TOCTOU (time of check, time of use)

## Hooks
###  do_exit
#### Type
Kprobe
#### Purpose
Hook the kernel entry point to trace process termination.

## Example Use Case
 Analyzing the exit status code of children processes.

## Issues
None

## Related Events
The `fork()` and `exec()` syscalls are related to this event since they are used 
to create and load a new process which will eventually terminate with the `exit()` 
syscall.
