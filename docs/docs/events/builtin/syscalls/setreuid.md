# setreuid

## Intro
setreuid - is a system call used to set the real and effective user identities. 

## Description
The setreuid() system call allows a process to set its real user ID, effective user ID and sub-process user ID. This call can be used by a process to set the user identity to its current user identity, that of its effective user identity, or to a specified user ID. 

By setting the effective user identity to a given user ID, a process is able to act as that user. This can be used by a process to gain additional privileges. However, elevating a process's privileges carries the risk of introducing security vulnerabilities. Therefore, due diligence and caution should be used when using this system call.

## Arguments 
* `ruid`: `uid_t` - specifies the real user identity of the process and is written to the ruid field in the uarea.
* `euid`: `uid_t` - specifies the effective user identity of the process and is written to the euid field in the uarea.

### Available tags 
K - Originated from kernel-space.
U - Originated from user space (for example, pointer to user space memory used to get it)

## Example Use Case
A process can use setreuid() to temporarily configure its user identity in order to execute a privileged operation.

## Issues
Security vulnerabilities can be introduced if elevating the process's privileges without proper care.
