# clock_getres

## Intro
clock_getres - This system call knows the resolution (precision) of the
specified clock, i.e. the period between successive readings.

## Description
The `clock_getres` system call gets current clock resolution for the specified clock. 
It returns the resolution of the clock, that is, how often clock periods occur. 
It is expressed in seconds and nanoseconds. It is allowed for the target of the `res` argument to be NULL.
In this case, the resolution is not returned though the system call does succeed.

One advantage of using this system call instead of other system calls to measure time is that 
it provides an accurate enough resolution to measure even small chunks of time. As such, 
it is widely used in benchmarking and performance testing applications. 
A potential drawback of using this system call to measure time is that the resolution of the clock is 
based on the system, so the accuracy of the measurement may vary across different system configurations. 

## Arguments
* `clockid`:`const clockid_t` - The clock ID to get the resolution of. 
* `res`:`struct timespec*`[K] - Pointer to a timespec structure filled by the kernel with the resolution of the clock. 

### Available Tags
* K - Originated from kernel-space.

## Hooks
### sys_clock_getres
#### Type
Kprobe + Kretprobe
#### Purpose
Hooking the `sys_clock_getres` function allows us to properly measure the time of execution of the `clock_getres` system call.

## Example Use Case
The `clock_getres` system call can be used in performance tests or benchmarking applications 
in order to accurately measure the time spent in certain parts of the code.

## Issues
No known issues.
