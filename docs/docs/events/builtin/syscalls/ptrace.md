# ptrace

## Intro

ptrace - process trace system call for controlling and observing another process

## Description

The `ptrace()` system call is a means by which one process, termed the "tracer",
can observe and control the execution of another process, known as the "tracee".

Through `ptrace()`, a tracer can examine and alter the tracee's memory and
registers, essentially gaining a mechanism to inspect and manipulate the
internal state of the tracee. The primary use case for `ptrace()` is in the
implementation of debugging tools and other code-analysis utilities, which serve
as aids in software development.

Additionally, `ptrace()` can be employed in malicious activities such as process
injection, where it is used to attach to and modify a running process by writing
arbitrary code into i.

## Arguments

* `request`:`int`[K] - The specific operation to be performed, determined by constant values defined in the system headers.
* `pid`:`pid_t`[K] - Process ID of the tracee.
* `addr`:`void *`[K] - Address in the tracee's memory or a request-dependent value.
* `data`:`void *`[K] - Data to be written to the tracee's memory or a request-dependent value.

### Available Tags

* K - Originated from kernel-space.
* U - Originated from user space.
* TOCTOU - Vulnerable to TOCTOU (time of check, time of use).
* OPT - Optional argument - might not always be available (passed with null value).

## Hooks

### sys_ptrace

#### Type

Tracepoint (through `sys_enter`).

#### Purpose

To observe and trace when the `ptrace()` system call is invoked and to gather
contextual information about the operation being performed, the target process,
and the data being accessed or modified.

## Example Use Case

Developing a security monitoring system that tracks the usage of `ptrace()` to
identify potentially malicious activities like process injection or unauthorized
debugging attempts.

## Issues

`ptrace()` can be used maliciously for process injection attacks, where an
attacker attaches to a running process to modify its behavior, potentially
leading to privilege escalation or other security breaches.

## Related Events

* `execve()` - Execution of new program in a process.
* `fork()` - Creation of a new process.
* `vfork()` - Creation of a new process, sharing memory with parent.
