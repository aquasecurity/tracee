# setreuid

## Intro

setreuid - set real and effective user IDs.

## Description

The `setreuid()` system call allows a process to set both its real user ID and
its effective user ID.

This provides flexibility in managing user-based privileges, especially for
processes that need to toggle between different levels of privileges
temporarily. In Unix-like systems, the real user ID identifies the user who
launched the process, whereas the effective user ID dictates the permissions for
process operations.

By modifying these IDs selectively, processes can execute specific tasks under
one identity and then revert to another, thereby enhancing system security by
minimizing the time a process runs with elevated privileges.

## Arguments

* `ruid`:`uid_t`[K] - The real user ID to be set. If this argument is -1, the real UID is not changed.
* `euid`:`uid_t`[K] - The effective user ID to be set. If this argument is -1, the effective UID is not changed.

### Available Tags

* K - Originated from kernel-space.
* U - Originated from user space.
* TOCTOU - Vulnerable to TOCTOU (time of check, time of use).
* OPT - Optional argument - might not always be available (passed with null value).

## Hooks

### sys_setreuid

#### Type

Tracepoint (through `sys_enter`).

#### Purpose

To observe and trace when the `setreuid()` system call is executed, capturing
information about the changes made to the real and effective user IDs.

## Example Use Case

Monitoring privilege transitions is crucial in environments that prioritize
security, particularly when tracking potential privilege escalation scenarios or
processes that are expected to change their operational context frequently.

## Issues

If misused or if programs leveraging `setreuid()` contain vulnerabilities, they
can be exploited to gain unauthorized privileges, leading to potential security
breaches.

## Related Events

* `setuid()` - Set the effective user ID of the calling process.
* `setresuid()` - Set real, effective, and saved user IDs.
* `seteuid()` - Set effective user ID.
