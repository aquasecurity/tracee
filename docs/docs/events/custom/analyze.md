# Analyze

The tracee subcommand `analyze` allows you to execute behavior signatures on past data. 
For example, you can collect the ptrace event into one node using the following command:

```
tracee --filter event=ptrace --output=json:events.json
```

Then, on another node, you can check if the behavior signature for anti-debugging was triggered using the following command:

```
tracee analyze --event=anti_debugging events.json
```

The `analyze` command can also be used to test new signatures from the collected past data. You can run tracee on a node, collect several events, and based on the collected events, create your behavior signature. Afterward, you can test if the signature would be triggered using the `analyze` command.
