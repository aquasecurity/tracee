# Docs

In this section you can find the complete reference documentation for all of the different features and settings that Tracee has to offer.

!!! Note
We have recently transitioned to a new architecture and user-experience, as detailed [here](https://github.com/aquasecurity/tracee/discussions/2499), and the documentation has been updated accordingly.  
If you using an older version of Tracee using `tracee-ebpf`/`tracee-rules`, please use the [classic docs](../classic-docs/docs/overview.md) section of the documentation.  

ðŸ‘ˆ Please use the side-navigation on the left in order to browse the different topics.
