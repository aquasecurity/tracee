# On cron schedule or on demand: Release snapshot (amd64 and arm64)

# This workflow ensures that the main branch is ready for release and that all
# build configuration files are valid. Also scans tracee container images for
# vulnerabilities, and publishes to DockerHub as aquasec/tracee:dev and
# aquasec/tracee:dev-full.
