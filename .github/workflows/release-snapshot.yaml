# Release snapshot on CRON schedule or on demand. This workflow ensures that
# the main branch is ready for release and that all build configuration files
# are valid. Also scans tracee container images for vulnerabilities, and
# publishes to DockerHub as aquasec/tracee:dev and aquasec/tracee:full-dev.
