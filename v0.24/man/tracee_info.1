.SS NAME
\f[B]tracee_info\f[R] \- export Tracee metadata and runtime information
.SS DESCRIPTION
This event is emitted during Tracee\[cq]s initialization and is
typically the first event generated.
It provides essential metadata about Tracee\[cq]s configuration and
runtime environment, which is valuable for event processing,
troubleshooting, and understanding the context of captured events.
.PP
The event is particularly useful when working with Tracee\[cq]s File
Source feature, as it provides information about how Tracee was
configured during the original capture.
.SS EVENT SETS
\f[B]none\f[R]
.SS DATA FIELDS
.TP
\f[B]boot_time\f[R] (\f[I]uint64\f[R])
The system boot time relative to the Unix epoch
.TP
\f[B]start_time\f[R] (\f[I]time.Time\f[R])
The time when the Tracee process started, relative to system boot time
.TP
\f[B]version\f[R] (\f[I]string\f[R])
The version of Tracee that generated the events
.SS DEPENDENCIES
This event has no dependencies as it is generated directly by Tracee
during initialization.
.SS USE CASES
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]Event timing\f[R]: Calculate relative timestamps for other events
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]Compatibility checking\f[R]: Verify event stream compatibility with
tools
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]Troubleshooting\f[R]: Identify environment\-specific issues
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]Audit logging\f[R]: Record Tracee version and runtime context
.SS IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
.IP \[bu] 2
Generated in user\-mode during initialization
.IP \[bu] 2
Always the first event in an event stream
.IP \[bu] 2
Provides foundational context for event processing
.IP \[bu] 2
No kernel probes or special permissions required
.SS EXAMPLES
The event can be used to calculate relative event timing:
.IP
.EX
relative_time = event.timestamp \- (tracee_info.boot_time + tracee_info.start_time)
