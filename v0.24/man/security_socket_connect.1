.SS NAME
\f[B]security_socket_connect\f[R] \- socket connection security check
.SS DESCRIPTION
Triggered when a socket attempts to establish a connection through the
Linux Security Module (LSM) hook.
This event captures information about the socket and the remote address
it\[cq]s trying to connect to, providing visibility into outbound
network communications.
.PP
The event monitors socket connections for security, diagnostics, and
compliance purposes by hooking into the kernel\[cq]s
\f[CR]security_socket_connect\f[R] function.
.SS EVENT SETS
\f[B]none\f[R]
.SS DATA FIELDS
.TP
\f[B]sockfd\f[R] (\f[I]int32\f[R])
The file descriptor referring to the socket attempting the connection
.TP
\f[B]remote_addr\f[R] (\f[I]trace.SockAddr\f[R])
The remote address structure containing connection destination details.
Depending on the address family (IPv4, IPv6, or UNIX), this contains
different address information
.SS DEPENDENCIES
\f[B]LSM Hook:\f[R]
.IP \[bu] 2
security_socket_connect (required): LSM hook for socket connection
security checks
.SS USE CASES
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]Security monitoring\f[R]: Track outbound connections to detect
malicious communications
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]Network auditing\f[R]: Monitor connections for compliance and
security policies
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]Incident response\f[R]: Investigate suspicious network connections
during security incidents
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]Application debugging\f[R]: Diagnose network connectivity issues in
applications
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]Traffic analysis\f[R]: Understand application network communication
patterns
.SS ADDRESS FAMILIES
The \f[CR]remote_addr\f[R] field can contain different address types:
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]IPv4\f[R]: \f[CR]sockaddr_in\f[R] structure with IP address and
port
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]IPv6\f[R]: \f[CR]sockaddr_in6\f[R] structure with IPv6 address and
port
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]UNIX\f[R]: \f[CR]sockaddr_un\f[R] structure with socket path
.SS PERFORMANCE CONSIDERATIONS
Monitoring every socket connection may introduce overhead in systems
with frequent network communications.
Consider filtering or adjusting monitoring scope for high\-throughput
environments.
