.SS NAME
\f[B]vfs_readv\f[R] \- track vectored reads from the virtual filesystem
.SS DESCRIPTION
This event captures read operations from files using the vectored I/O
interface (readv).
It is triggered by the VFS (Virtual File System) layer implementation of
\f[CR]readv\f[R], \f[CR]preadv\f[R], and \f[CR]preadv2\f[R] system calls
after file descriptor resolution.
.PP
The event provides information about the file being read, including its
path and location in the filesystem, as well as details about the read
operation such as the number of buffers and read position.
.SS EVENT SETS
\f[B]none\f[R]
.SS DATA FIELDS
.TP
\f[B]pathname\f[R] (\f[I]string\f[R])
The path of the file being read
.TP
\f[B]dev\f[R] (\f[I]uint32\f[R])
The device ID where the file resides
.TP
\f[B]inode\f[R] (\f[I]uint64\f[R])
The inode number of the file on the device
.TP
\f[B]vlen\f[R] (\f[I]uint64\f[R])
The number of buffers in the I/O vector for this read operation
.TP
\f[B]pos\f[R] (\f[I]int64\f[R])
The file offset where the read operation starts
.SS DEPENDENCIES

.SS IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
.IP \[bu] 2
Triggered by the VFS layer, independent of specific filesystems
.IP \[bu] 2
Captures vectored reads from \f[CR]readv\f[R], \f[CR]preadv\f[R], and
\f[CR]preadv2\f[R] syscalls
.IP \[bu] 2
Does not capture other read methods like \f[CR]read\f[R], memory
mapping, etc.
.IP \[bu] 2
Uses both entry and return probes for complete operation tracking
