.SS NAME
\f[B]net_flow_tcp_begin\f[R] \- TCP connection initiation detected
.SS DESCRIPTION
Triggered when a TCP connection is initiated, derived from raw network
events captured by cgroup skb eBPF programs.
This event monitors the TCP protocol\[cq]s initiation phase by analyzing
IP and TCP headers, specifically focusing on SYN, ACK, and FIN flag
statuses to identify the start of TCP communication flows.
.PP
The event leverages kernel\-level packet capture to provide critical
data for network monitoring and security analysis, offering visibility
into TCP connection establishment patterns.
