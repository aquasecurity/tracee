Tracee has been successfully installed as a set of pods scheduled on each Kubernetes cluster
node controlled by the `{{ include "tracee.fullname" . }}` DaemonSet in the `{{ .Release.Namespace}}` namespace.
By default, threat detections are printed to the standard output of each pod:

$ kubectl logs -f daemonset/{{ include "tracee.fullname" . }} -n {{ .Release.Namespace }}
