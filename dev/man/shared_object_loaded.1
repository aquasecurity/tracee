.SS NAME
\f[B]shared_object_loaded\f[R] \- shared library loading detection
.SS DESCRIPTION
Triggered when a shared library (.so file) is loaded into a process
memory space through memory mapping operations.
This event captures shared library loading by monitoring memory mapping
operations performed on executable shared objects, providing detailed
information about library loading patterns and dependencies.
.PP
Shared library loading is fundamental to dynamic linking and process
execution, but can also be used in injection attacks, library hijacking,
or malware loading techniques.
