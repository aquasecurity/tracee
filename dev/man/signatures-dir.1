.SS NAME
tracee \f[B]\-\-signatures\-dir\f[R] \- Specify directories to search
for signature plugins
.SS SYNOPSIS
tracee \f[B]\-\-signatures\-dir\f[R]
.PP
[\f[B]\-\-signatures\-dir\f[R] ]
.SS DESCRIPTION
The \f[B]\-\-signatures\-dir\f[R] flag allows you to specify one or more
directories where Tracee should search for signature plugins in Go
plugin (.so) format.
.PP
Signatures are security detection rules that can detect suspicious or
malicious behavior patterns.
They are compiled as Go plugins and loaded dynamically at runtime.
.PP
When Tracee starts, it searches for signature plugins in:
.IP \[bu] 2
The directories specified by \f[B]\-\-signatures\-dir\f[R] flags, or
.IP \[bu] 2
Default signatures
.PP
Each signature plugin file must be a compiled Go plugin (.so file) that
implements the Tracee signature interface.
Loaded signatures create corresponding signature events that can be
traced using policies or event flags.
.SS EXAMPLES
.IP \[bu] 2
Specify a single directory:
.RS 2
.IP
.EX
\-\-signatures\-dir /opt/tracee/signatures
.EE
.RE
.IP \[bu] 2
Specify multiple directories:
.RS 2
.IP
.EX
\-\-signatures\-dir /opt/tracee/signatures \-\-signatures\-dir /custom/signatures
.EE
.RE
.IP \[bu] 2
Use with policy to trace signature events:
.RS 2
.IP
.EX
tracee \-\-signatures\-dir /opt/tracee/signatures \-\-policy ./security\-policy.yaml
.EE
.RE
.IP \[bu] 2
List available signature events:
.RS 2
.IP
.EX
tracee \-\-signatures\-dir /opt/tracee/signatures list
.EE
.RE
.SS SIGNATURE PLUGINS
Signature plugins are compiled Go shared libraries (.so files) that
implement the Tracee signature interface.
Each plugin can define one or more signatures that detect specific
security events or patterns.
.PP
When a signature plugin is loaded:
.IP \[bu] 2
The signatures it defines become available as traceable events
.IP \[bu] 2
These events can be referenced in policies or event flags
.IP \[bu] 2
Signature events are typically prefixed to distinguish them from system
events
.PP
To create custom signatures, refer to the Tracee signature development
documentation.
.SS NOTES
.IP \[bu] 2
Signature plugins must be compiled for the same architecture and Go
version as Tracee
.IP \[bu] 2
Only valid Go plugin files (.so) will be loaded from the specified
directories
.IP \[bu] 2
If no signatures are found, Tracee will continue to run but signature
events will not be available
.IP \[bu] 2
The \f[B]\-\-signatures\-dir\f[R] flag can be used with the
\f[B]list\f[R] command to see available signature events before running
Tracee
