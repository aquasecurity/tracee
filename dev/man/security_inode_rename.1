.SS NAME
\f[B]security_inode_rename\f[R] \- LSM inode rename operation monitoring
.SS DESCRIPTION
Triggered when the Linux Security Module (LSM) framework performs
security checks on inode rename operations.
This event captures file and directory rename operations at the LSM
level, providing detailed information about filesystem object renaming
with complete path information.
.PP
File and directory renaming operations can have security implications,
including attempts to hide files, evade detection, or bypass access
controls, making LSM\-level monitoring valuable for security analysis.
