.SS NAME
\f[B]cgroup_rmdir\f[R] \- Event triggered when a cgroup directory is
removed
.SS DESCRIPTION
The \f[B]cgroup_rmdir\f[R] event monitors the removal of directories
within the cgroup filesystem.
As containers are orchestrated and managed using control groups
(cgroups), the removal of a directory often indicates the termination or
scaling down of a container instance.
.PP
By monitoring these directory removal events, operators can capture
crucial insights into container terminations, resource deallocations,
and other significant container lifecycle events within the system.
.PP
This event is pivotal for administrators looking to scrutinize container
lifecycle events and for understanding the orchestration dynamics in
complex containerized environments.

\f[B]Container Termination Monitoring\f[R]: By tracing cgroup directory
removals, the system can identify when containers are terminated,
offering a perspective into system scaling dynamics and potential
anomalies
