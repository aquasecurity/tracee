.SS NAME
\f[B]anti_debugging\f[R] \- detect anti\-debugging technique usage
.SS DESCRIPTION
Triggered when processes employ anti\-debugging techniques to thwart or
block debugger efforts.
This security signature detects the usage of the \f[CR]ptrace\f[R]
system call with the \f[CR]PTRACE_TRACEME\f[R] request, which is
commonly used by malware or commercial applications to deter analysis
and reverse engineering.
.PP
When a process invokes \f[CR]ptrace\f[R] with \f[CR]PTRACE_TRACEME\f[R],
it\[cq]s asking to be traced by its parent, which can be used to
determine if it\[cq]s currently being debugged.
This technique is often employed as a defense evasion mechanism.
