.SS NAME
\f[B]vfs_write\f[R] \- virtual filesystem write operation monitoring
.SS DESCRIPTION
Triggered when a write operation to a file is performed through the
Virtual File System (VFS) layer.
This event captures file write operations at the kernel VFS level,
providing filesystem\-agnostic monitoring of write operations across all
supported filesystems.
.PP
The event hooks into the VFS implementation after file descriptor
resolution, offering detailed information about file write patterns and
data modification activities.
