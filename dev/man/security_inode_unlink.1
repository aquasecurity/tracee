.SS NAME
\f[B]security_inode_unlink\f[R] \- security check before unlinking an
inode
.SS DESCRIPTION
Triggered when an inode is about to be unlinked, representing file or
directory deletion operations.
This LSM (Linux Security Module) hook event captures detailed
information about the inode being unlinked, including its path,
filesystem metadata, and timing information.
.PP
The event provides critical visibility into file deletion operations,
which is essential for security monitoring, system auditing, and
tracking changes to sensitive files or directories.
It captures the state of the file or directory before it is removed from
the filesystem.
.PP
This event is useful for:

requirements
.SS EVENT SETS
\f[B]none\f[R]
.SS DATA FIELDS
.TP
\f[B]pathname\f[R] (\f[I]string\f[R])
The path to the file or directory being unlinked
.TP
\f[B]inode\f[R] (\f[I]uint64\f[R])
Inode number of the file or directory
.TP
