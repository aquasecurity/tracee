.SS NAME
\f[B]do_exit\f[R] \- kernel process exit function monitoring
.SS DESCRIPTION
Triggered when the kernel\[cq]s \f[CR]do_exit\f[R] function is invoked
during process termination.
This function handles the core process termination logic in the Linux
kernel, including resource cleanup, parent notification, and the actual
termination work.
.PP
This event provides insight into the kernel\[cq]s internal process
cleanup mechanisms and is more low\-level compared to
\f[CR]sched_process_exit\f[R].
It\[cq]s useful for understanding kernel\-level process termination
behavior and debugging process exit issues.
.SS EVENT SETS
\f[B]proc\f[R], \f[B]proc_life\f[R]
.SS DATA FIELDS
This event currently does not capture specific arguments, but provides
timing and context information about when the kernel\[cq]s process exit
handler is invoked.
