.SS NAME
\f[B]cgroup_attach_task\f[R] \- cgroup task attachment monitoring
.SS DESCRIPTION
Triggered when a task is attached to a cgroup through the kernel\[cq]s
cgroup subsystem.
This event captures process assignments to control groups, which are
fundamental to container resource management, process isolation, and
system resource control.
.PP
Cgroup attachments are core to container operations and resource
management, and monitoring these operations provides insight into
container lifecycle and resource allocation patterns.
