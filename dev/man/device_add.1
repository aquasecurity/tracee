.SS NAME
\f[B]device_add\f[R] \- device registration monitoring
.SS DESCRIPTION
Triggered when a new device is added to the kernel\[cq]s device model
using the \f[CR]device_add\f[R] function.
This event captures device registration operations performed by drivers
when they register new hardware devices, virtual devices, or other
device objects with the kernel.
.PP
Device registration is fundamental to the Linux device model and driver
framework, but can also be used by rootkits or malicious drivers to
register hidden devices or maintain persistence.
