.SS NAME
\f[B]cgroup_mkdir\f[R] \- cgroup directory creation
.SS DESCRIPTION
Triggered when a new cgroup directory is created in the cgroup
filesystem.
This event tracks the creation of new cgroup directories, which often
signals container initiation, process group creation, or resource
management operations.
.PP
Since containers utilize control groups (cgroups) for resource
management and isolation, monitoring cgroup directory creation provides
valuable insights into container operations, resource allocations, and
overall system container activity.
.PP
This event is useful for:
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]Container lifecycle monitoring\f[R]: Track container creation and
resource allocation
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]Resource management\f[R]: Monitor cgroup\-based resource control
mechanisms
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]System activity analysis\f[R]: Understand process grouping and
isolation patterns
.SS EVENT SETS
\f[B]none\f[R]
.SS DATA FIELDS
.TP
\f[B]cgroup_id\f[R] (\f[I]uint64\f[R])
The unique identifier for the cgroup
.TP
\f[B]cgroup_path\f[R] (\f[I]string\f[R])
The filesystem path to the cgroup directory
.TP
\f[B]hierarchy_id\f[R] (\f[I]uint32\f[R])
Identifier indicating the hierarchy level of the cgroup
.SS DEPENDENCIES
\f[B]Kernel Tracepoint:\f[R]
.IP \[bu] 2
cgroup_mkdir (raw tracepoint, required): Kernel tracepoint for cgroup
directory creation
.SS USE CASES
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]Container monitoring\f[R]: Detect when new containers are created
by tracking cgroup creation
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]Resource accounting\f[R]: Monitor cgroup creation for resource
utilization tracking
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]Security monitoring\f[R]: Identify unexpected or malicious
container creation activity
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]System administration\f[R]: Track container orchestration and
resource management
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]Performance analysis\f[R]: Monitor container lifecycle and resource
allocation patterns
.SS CGROUP HIERARCHY
Cgroups are organized in hierarchies:
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]v1 (legacy)\f[R]: Multiple hierarchies with different controllers
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]v2 (unified)\f[R]: Single unified hierarchy with all controllers
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]Hierarchy ID\f[R]: Identifies which cgroup hierarchy the directory
belongs to
.SS CONTAINER RELATIONSHIP
Cgroup directory creation often correlates with:
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]Container creation\f[R]: New containers typically create new cgroup
directories
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]Process isolation\f[R]: Applications using cgroups for resource
control
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]Resource limits\f[R]: Setting up resource constraints and
monitoring
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]Namespace isolation\f[R]: Combined with other isolation mechanisms
.SS PERFORMANCE CONSIDERATIONS
This event can be frequent in container\-heavy environments.
Consider filtering or adjusting monitoring scope based on:
.IP \[bu] 2
Specific cgroup paths of interest
.IP \[bu] 2
Container runtime patterns
.IP \[bu] 2
Resource management policies
