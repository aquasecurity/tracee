.SS NAME
\f[B]print_mem_dump\f[R] \- memory dump printing for analysis
.SS DESCRIPTION
Triggered during Tracee initialization when configured to dump memory
content from a specific address.
This event accepts a memory address and dumps the requested memory
region for analysis and debugging purposes.
.PP
The event is configured via CLI parameters that specify the target
memory address, dump length, and optionally symbol names.
It uses a uprobe mechanism to capture and dump the memory content when
Tracee starts up.
