.SS NAME
\f[B]commit_creds\f[R] \- credential change operation monitoring
.SS DESCRIPTION
Triggered when new credentials are committed for a process using the
kernel\[cq]s \f[CR]commit_creds\f[R] function.
This event captures credential changes including user ID, group ID, and
capability modifications, providing detailed information about privilege
transitions and security context changes.
.PP
Credential changes are fundamental to security monitoring as they
represent privilege escalation, user switching, and security context
modifications that could be legitimate operations or security threats.
