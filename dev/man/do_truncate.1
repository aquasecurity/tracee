.SS NAME
\f[B]do_truncate\f[R] \- file truncation operation monitoring
.SS DESCRIPTION
Triggered when a file truncation operation is performed using the
kernel\[cq]s \f[CR]do_truncate\f[R] function.
This event captures file size reduction operations, which can completely
clear file contents or reduce files to a specific size, providing
monitoring of potentially destructive file operations.
.PP
File truncation can be used to clear sensitive data, reduce file sizes,
or as part of normal application operations, making this event valuable
for security and data integrity monitoring.
.SS EVENT SETS
