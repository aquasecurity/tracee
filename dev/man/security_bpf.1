.SS NAME
\f[B]security_bpf\f[R] \- LSM BPF operation monitoring
.SS DESCRIPTION
Triggered when the Linux Security Module (LSM) framework performs
security checks on BPF (Berkeley Packet Filter) operations.
This event provides information about BPF\-related system calls and
operations, which are increasingly important for security monitoring as
BPF is used for various system\-level operations including networking,
tracing, and security enforcement.
.PP
BPF programs can be powerful tools but also potential security risks if
misused, making this event valuable for monitoring BPF usage and
detecting potential abuse.
