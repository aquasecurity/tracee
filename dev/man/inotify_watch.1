.SS NAME
\f[B]inotify_watch\f[R] \- filesystem watch setup monitoring
.SS DESCRIPTION
Triggered when an inotify watch is established on a file or directory
through the kernel\[cq]s inotify subsystem.
This event captures the setup of filesystem monitoring watches, which
applications use to receive notifications about file and directory
changes in real\-time.
.PP
Inotify watches are commonly used by applications for file monitoring,
but can also be used by malware for surveillance purposes, making this
event valuable for security monitoring.
