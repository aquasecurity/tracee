.SS NAME
\f[B]process_execute_failed\f[R] \- a failed process execution occurred
.SS DESCRIPTION
A high\-level event that captures process execution failures, providing
detailed information about the failed execution attempt including the
binary path, interpreter details, and execution context.
This event aims to encompass all failure cases of process execution
while providing kernel\-level execution arguments.
.PP
The event provides comprehensive visibility into execution failures,
which is crucial for debugging application issues, detecting security
problems, and monitoring system behavior.
It captures both user\-space and kernel\-initiated execution attempts.
.PP
This event is useful for:

\f[B]Execution debugging\f[R]: Track and analyze process execution
failures
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]Security monitoring\f[R]: Detect failed execution attempts that
might indicate attacks
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]System diagnostics\f[R]: Understand process execution issues
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]Permission analysis\f[R]: Monitor access control failures

.SS DEPENDENCIES
\f[B]Kernel Version >= 5.8:\f[R]
.IP \[bu] 2
security_bprm_creds_for_exec (kprobe, required): Retrieve execution
arguments
.IP \[bu] 2
sys_enter (tracepoint, required): Obtain execution return code
.PP
\f[B]Kernel Version < 5.8:\f[R]
.IP \[bu] 2
exec_binprm (kprobe + kretprobe, required): Retrieve execution arguments
and return value
.SS USE CASES
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]Application debugging\f[R]: Identify why process executions are
failing
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]Security monitoring\f[R]: Detect unauthorized execution attempts
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]System diagnostics\f[R]: Track execution failures for system health
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]Permission analysis\f[R]: Monitor access control and capability
issues
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]Configuration validation\f[R]: Verify execution environment setup
.SS KERNEL VERSION CONSIDERATIONS
The event behavior varies by kernel version:
.PP
\f[B]Kernel >= 5.8:\f[R] \- Uses security_bprm_creds_for_exec hook \-
More comprehensive failure detection \- Better execution context
information
.PP
\f[B]Kernel < 5.8:\f[R] \- Uses exec_binprm hook \- Limited to failures
within exec_binprm \- May miss early\-stage failures
.SS LIMITATIONS
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]Kernel < 5.8\f[R]: May miss failures occurring before exec_binprm
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]Kernel >= 5.8\f[R]: May miss failures before
security_bprm_creds_for_exec
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]exec_binprm symbol\f[R]: May not be available in some systems
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]TOCTOU\f[R]: Environment and arguments subject to race conditions
