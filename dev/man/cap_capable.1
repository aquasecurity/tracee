.SS NAME
\f[B]cap_capable\f[R] \- capability permission check monitoring
.SS DESCRIPTION
Triggered when the Linux Security Module (LSM) framework checks whether
a process has a specific capability.
Capabilities in Linux divide the privileges traditionally associated
with the superuser into distinct units that can be independently enabled
or disabled.
.PP
This event provides insight into capability checks happening at the
kernel level, which is essential for understanding privilege escalation
attempts, security policy enforcement, and debugging permission\-related
issues.
