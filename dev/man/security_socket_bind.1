.SS NAME
\f[B]security_socket_bind\f[R] \- socket bind operation security check
.SS DESCRIPTION
Triggered when a socket is bound to a local address and port through the
Linux Security Module (LSM) hook.
This event captures socket binding operations, which are crucial for
setting up servers, defining source addresses for outgoing connections,
and establishing network services.
.PP
Socket binding is a fundamental networking operation where applications
specify which local address and port they want to use for network
communication.
Monitoring these operations provides visibility into service
initialization and network configuration changes.
.PP
This event is useful for:
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]Service monitoring\f[R]: Track server and service initialization
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]Network security\f[R]: Monitor unexpected port bindings and service
exposure
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]Configuration auditing\f[R]: Verify intended network service
configurations
.SS EVENT SETS
\f[B]none\f[R]
.SS DATA FIELDS
.TP
\f[B]sockfd\f[R] (\f[I]int32\f[R])
The file descriptor referring to the socket being bound
.TP
\f[B]local_addr\f[R] (\f[I]trace.SockAddr\f[R])
The local address structure containing the address and port details for
the binding operation

to listening ports
.IP \[bu] 2

interfaces
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]Privilege port binding\f[R]: Binding to ports below 1024 (requires
privileges)
.SS ADDRESS FAMILIES
The \f[CR]local_addr\f[R] field contains different address types:
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]IPv4\f[R]: \f[CR]sockaddr_in\f[R] with IPv4 address and port
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]IPv6\f[R]: \f[CR]sockaddr_in6\f[R] with IPv6 address and port
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]UNIX\f[R]: \f[CR]sockaddr_un\f[R] with filesystem socket path
.SS SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS
Monitor for suspicious binding patterns:
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]Privilege escalation\f[R]: Unauthorized binding to privileged ports
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]Service hijacking\f[R]: Binding to ports used by other services
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]Backdoor services\f[R]: Unexpected services binding to unusual
ports
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]Network reconnaissance\f[R]: Applications probing port availability
.SS PORT CATEGORIES
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]Well\-known ports (0\-1023)\f[R]: Require root privileges to bind
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]Registered ports (1024\-49151)\f[R]: Commonly used application
ports
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]Dynamic/private ports (49152\-65535)\f[R]: Typically used for
client connections
.SS PERFORMANCE CONSIDERATIONS
Socket binding events are relatively infrequent compared to data
transfer operations, but can be numerous in environments with frequent
service starts/stops or applications that create many sockets.
