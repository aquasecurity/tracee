.SS NAME
\f[B]set_fs_pwd\f[R] \- track changes to the current working directory
.SS DESCRIPTION
This event captures changes to the current working directory (typically
through \f[CR]chdir\f[R] and \f[CR]fchdir\f[R] syscalls).
It provides both the user\-supplied path and the fully resolved
filesystem path, helping track directory traversal and potential path
manipulation attempts.
.PP
This event is useful for:
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]Process monitoring\f[R]: Track directory changes of processes
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]Security auditing\f[R]: Monitor for suspicious directory access
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]Debugging\f[R]: Troubleshoot path\-related issues
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]Compliance\f[R]: Track file system access patterns
.SS EVENT SETS
\f[B]none\f[R]
.SS DATA FIELDS
.TP
\f[B]unresolved_path\f[R] (\f[I]string\f[R])
The unresolved, user\-supplied path for the directory change.
This may contain relative paths, symlinks, or \[lq]..\[rq] components.
Only available for changes using the \f[CR]chdir\f[R] syscall.
.TP
\f[B]resolved_path\f[R] (\f[I]string\f[R])
The fully resolved filesystem path after all symlinks and relative
components are resolved.
.SS DEPENDENCIES
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[CR]set_fs_pwd\f[R]: Kernel probe to catch changes to the current
working directory
.SS USE CASES
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]Directory traversal detection\f[R]: Monitor for suspicious path
traversal patterns
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]Access auditing\f[R]: Track which directories processes are
accessing
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]Symlink resolution\f[R]: Understand the relationship between
user\-provided and resolved paths
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]Process behavior analysis\f[R]: Map process directory access
patterns
.SS IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
The event uses a kprobe on the kernel\[cq]s \f[CR]set_fs_pwd\f[R]
function to capture directory changes.
This provides visibility into:
.IP \[bu] 2
Direct directory changes via \f[CR]chdir\f[R]
.IP \[bu] 2
File descriptor\-based changes via \f[CR]fchdir\f[R]
.IP \[bu] 2
Relative vs absolute path resolution
.IP \[bu] 2
Symlink traversal
.SS SECURITY IMPLICATIONS
Directory changes can indicate:
.IP \[bu] 2
Privilege escalation attempts through path traversal
.IP \[bu] 2
Data exfiltration via sensitive directory access
.IP \[bu] 2
Malware persistence through specific directory targeting
.IP \[bu] 2
Evasion techniques using path manipulation
