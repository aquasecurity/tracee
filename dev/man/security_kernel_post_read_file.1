.SS NAME
\f[B]security_kernel_post_read_file\f[R] \- LSM post\-read kernel file
operation monitoring
.SS DESCRIPTION
Triggered after the Linux Security Module (LSM) framework completes
security checks on kernel\-initiated file read operations.
This event provides information about the completion of kernel file
reads, including the file path, size of data read, and the type of
operation.
.PP
This event complements security_kernel_read_file by providing
post\-operation information, allowing for complete tracking of kernel
file read operations from initiation to completion with success and data
size metrics.
.SS EVENT SETS

\f[B]pathname\f[R] (\f[I]string\f[R])
The path of the file that was read by the kernel
.TP
\f[B]size\f[R] (\f[I]int64\f[R])
The size of data read from the file
.TP
