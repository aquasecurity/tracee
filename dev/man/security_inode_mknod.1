.SS NAME
\f[B]security_inode_mknod\f[R] \- LSM inode creation operation
monitoring
.SS DESCRIPTION
Triggered when the Linux Security Module (LSM) framework performs
security checks on inode creation operations, specifically the mknod
system call.
The mknod operation creates filesystem nodes such as device files, named
pipes (FIFOs), and other special files.
.PP
This event is important for security monitoring as creating device nodes
or special files can be used for privilege escalation, creating covert
communication channels, or bypassing security controls.
.SS EVENT SETS

.SS DATA FIELDS
.TP
\f[B]file_name\f[R] (\f[I]string\f[R])
The name/path of the file being created
.TP
\f[B]mode\f[R] (\f[I]uint16\f[R])
The file mode and type (permissions and file type)
