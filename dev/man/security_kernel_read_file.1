.SS NAME
\f[B]security_kernel_read_file\f[R] \- LSM kernel file read operation
monitoring
.SS DESCRIPTION
Triggered when the Linux Security Module (LSM) framework performs
security checks on kernel\-initiated file read operations.
This includes operations such as loading kernel modules, firmware, and
other kernel\-level file access operations that may bypass normal
user\-space file access controls.
.PP
This event is particularly important for security monitoring as it
captures kernel\-level file access that can indicate kernel module
loading, firmware updates, or other system\-level operations with
security implications.
