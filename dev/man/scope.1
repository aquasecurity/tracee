.SS DESCRIPTION
The \f[B]\-\-scope\f[R] flag allows you to select the scope for tracing
events by defining filters.
.SS FILTER EXPRESSION
Filter expressions can be defined to operate on scope options or process
metadata.
Only events that match all filter expressions will be traced.
.PP
Multiple flags are combined with AND logic, while multiple values within
a single flag are combined with OR logic when using the equals operator
`='.
Multiple values can be specified using `,'.
.SS NUMERICAL EXPRESSION OPERATORS
The following numerical fields support the operators `=', `!=', `<',
`>', `<=', `>=':
.IP \[bu] 2
uid: Select events from specific user IDs.
.IP \[bu] 2
pid: Select events from specific process IDs.
.PP
The following numerical fields only support the operators `=' and `!=':
.IP \[bu] 2
mntns: Select events from specific mount namespace IDs.
.IP \[bu] 2
pidns: Select events from specific process namespace IDs.
.IP \[bu] 2
tree: Select events that descend from specific process IDs.
.PP
NOTE: Expressions containing `<' or `>' tokens must be escaped!
.SS STRING EXPRESSION OPERATORS
`=', `!='
.PP
Available for the following string fields:
.IP \[bu] 2
uts: Select events based on UTS (Unix Timesharing System) names.
.IP \[bu] 2
comm: Select events based on process command names.
.IP \[bu] 2
container: Select events from specific container IDs.
.IP \[bu] 2
executable: Select events based on the executable path.
.PP
Strings can be compared as a prefix if ending with `*', or as a suffix
if starting with `*'.
.PP
NOTE: Expressions containing `*' token must be escaped!
.PP
you can learn more about the wildcard in the \f[CR]event\f[R] section.
.SS BOOLEAN OPERATOR (PREPENDED)
`!'
.PP
Available for the following boolean field:
.IP \[bu] 2
container: Select events based on whether they originate from a
container or not.
.SS SPECIAL FILTERS
The following special filters can be used within the scope filter
expressions:
.IP \[bu] 2
new: Select newly created containers or process IDs.
.IP \[bu] 2
follow: Select events from the processes that match the criteria and
their descendants.
