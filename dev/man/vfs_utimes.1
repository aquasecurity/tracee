.SS NAME
\f[B]vfs_utimes\f[R] \- virtual filesystem timestamp update monitoring
.SS DESCRIPTION
Triggered when file timestamps (access time and modification time) are
updated through the Virtual File System (VFS) layer.
This event captures timestamp modification operations across all
filesystems, providing monitoring of when file times are explicitly
changed by applications or system operations.
.PP
The event monitors both user\-initiated timestamp changes and
system\-level timestamp updates, offering insight into file metadata
modifications that could be security\-relevant.
