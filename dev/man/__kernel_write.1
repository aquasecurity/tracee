.SS NAME
**__kernel_write** \- kernel\-level write operation monitoring
.SS DESCRIPTION
Triggered when a write operation is performed directly by kernel code
using the \f[CR]__kernel_write\f[R] function.
This event captures kernel\-initiated write operations that bypass
normal user\-space write paths, providing insight into kernel\-level
file modifications and system operations.
.PP
These operations are typically performed by kernel subsystems, drivers,
or system processes that need to write data directly to files without
going through standard user\-space interfaces.

.SS DATA FIELDS
.TP
\f[B]pathname\f[R] (\f[I]string\f[R])
The path of the file being written to by kernel code
.TP
\f[B]dev\f[R] (\f[I]uint32\f[R])
The device identifier where the file resides
.TP
\f[B]inode\f[R] (\f[I]uint64\f[R])
The inode number of the file on the device
.TP
\f[B]count\f[R] (\f[I]uint64\f[R])
The number of bytes requested to be written
.TP
\f[B]pos\f[R] (\f[I]int64\f[R])
The file position offset where the write operation starts
