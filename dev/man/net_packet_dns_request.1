.SS NAME
net_packet_dns_request \- DNS request packet capture event
.SS DESCRIPTION
The \f[B]net_packet_dns_request\f[R] event shows DNS queries only.
It provides one event for each existing DNS packet containing a query
that reaches or leaves one of the processes being traced (or all OS
processes for the default run).
.PP
DNS queries come in various types, each serving a specific purpose in
the domain name resolution process or in retrieving information from DNS
servers.
Common types include:
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]Standard Query (A or AAAA)\f[R]: Requests IPv4 (A) or IPv6 (AAAA)
address for a domain name
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]Inverse Query (PTR)\f[R]: Provides an IP address and asks for the
associated domain name
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]Mail Exchange Query (MX)\f[R]: Retrieves mail exchange servers for
a specific domain
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]Name Server Query (NS)\f[R]: Discovers authoritative name servers
for a domain
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]Start of Authority Query (SOA)\f[R]: Retrieves SOA record
containing essential domain information
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]Service Query (SRV)\f[R]: Locates services associated with a
specific domain
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]Text Query (TXT)\f[R]: Retrieves text\-based information associated
with a domain
