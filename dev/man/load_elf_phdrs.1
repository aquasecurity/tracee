.SS NAME
\f[B]load_elf_phdrs\f[R] \- ELF program header loading monitoring
.SS DESCRIPTION
Triggered when ELF (Executable and Linkable Format) program headers are
loaded using the kernel\[cq]s \f[CR]load_elf_phdrs\f[R] function.
This event captures the loading of ELF program headers during executable
loading and dynamic linking operations, providing insight into binary
loading and execution patterns.
.PP
ELF program header loading is part of the executable loading process and
provides detailed information about how binaries are loaded and
organized in memory.
.SS EVENT SETS
\f[B]proc\f[R]
.SS DATA FIELDS
.TP
\f[B]pathname\f[R] (\f[I]string\f[R])
The path of the ELF file whose program headers are being loaded
.TP
\f[B]dev\f[R] (\f[I]uint32\f[R])
The device identifier where the ELF file resides
.TP
\f[B]inode\f[R] (\f[I]uint64\f[R])
The inode number of the ELF file
